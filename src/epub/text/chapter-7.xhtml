				<p class="pfirst">Descend from Heav’n <i>Urania</i>, by that name<br/>
If rightly thou art call’d, whose Voice divine<br/>
Following, above th’ <i>Olympian</i> Hill I soare,<br/>
Above the flight of <i>Pegasean</i> wing.<br/>
The meaning, not the Name I call: for thou<br/>
Nor of the Muses nine, nor on the top<br/>
Of old <i>Olympus</i> dwell’st, but Heav’nlie borne,<br/>
Before the Hills appeerd, or Fountain flow’d,<br/>
Thou with Eternal wisdom didst converse,<br/>
Wisdom thy Sister, and with her didst play<br/>
In presence of th’ Almightie Father, pleas’d<br/>
With thy Celestial Song.  Up led by thee<br/>
Into the Heav’n of Heav’ns I have presum’d,<br/>
An Earthlie Guest, and drawn Empyreal Aire,<br/>
Thy tempring; with like safetie guided down<br/>
Return me to my Native Element:<br/>
Least from this flying Steed unrein’d, (as once<br/>
<i>Bellerophon</i>, though from a lower Clime)<br/>
Dismounted, on th’ <i>Aleian</i> Field I fall<br/>
Erroneous, there to wander and forlorne.<br/>
Half yet remaines unsung, but narrower bound<br/>
Within the visible Diurnal Spheare;<br/>
Standing on Earth, not rapt above the Pole,<br/>
More safe I Sing with mortal voice, unchang’d<br/>
To hoarce or mute, though fall’n on evil dayes,<br/>
On evil dayes though fall’n, and evil tongues;<br/>
In darkness, and with dangers compast rouud,<br/>
And solitude; yet not alone, while thou<br/>
Visit’st my slumbers Nightly, or when Morn<br/>
Purples the East: still govern thou my Song,<br/>
<i>Urania</i>, and fit audience find, though few.<br/>
But drive farr off the barbarous dissonance<br/>
Of <i>Bacchus</i> and his Revellers, the Race<br/>
Of that wilde Rout that tore the <i>Thracian</i> Bard<br/>
In <i>Rhodope</i>, where Woods and Rocks had Eares<br/>
To rapture, till the savage clamor dround<br/>
Both Harp and Voice; nor could the Muse defend<br/>
Her Son.  So fail not thou, who thee implores:<br/>
For thou art Heav’nlie, shee an empty dreame.<br/>
</p>
				<p class="poem">Say Goddess, what ensu’d when <i>Raphael</i>,<br/>
The affable Arch-angel, had forewarn’d<br/>
<i>Adam</i> by dire example to beware<br/>
Apostasie, by what befell in Heaven<br/>
To those Apostates, least the like befall<br/>
In Paradise to <i>Adam</i> or his Race,<br/>
Charg’d not to touch the interdicted Tree,<br/>
If they transgress, and slight that sole command,<br/>
So easily obeyd amid the choice<br/>
Of all tasts else to please thir appetite,<br/>
Though wandring.  He with his consorted <i>Eve</i><br/>
The storie heard attentive, and was fill’d<br/>
With admiration, and deep Muse to heare<br/>
Of things so high and strange, things to thir thought<br/>
So unimaginable as hate in Heav’n,<br/>
And Warr so neer the Peace of God in bliss<br/>
With such confusion: but the evil soon<br/>
Driv’n back redounded as a flood on those<br/>
From whom it sprung, impossible to mix<br/>
With Blessedness.  Whence <i>Adam</i> soon repeal’d<br/>
The doubts that in his heart arose: and now<br/>
Led on, yet sinless, with desire to know<br/>
What neerer might concern him, how this World<br/>
Of Heav’n and Earth conspicuous first began,<br/>
When, and whereof created, for what cause,<br/>
What within <i>Eden</i> or without was done<br/>
Before his memorie, as one whose drouth<br/>
Yet scarce allay’d still eyes the current streame,<br/>
Whose liquid murmur heard new thirst excites,<br/>
Proceeded thus to ask his Heav’nly Guest.<br/>
</p>
				<p class="poem">Great things, and full of wonder in our eares,<br/>
Farr differing from this World, thou hast reveal’d<br/>
Divine Interpreter, by favour sent<br/>
Down from the Empyrean to forewarne<br/>
Us timely of what might else have bin our loss,<br/>
Unknown, which human knowledg could not reach:<br/>
For which to the infinitly Good we owe<br/>
Immortal thanks, and his admonishment<br/>
Receave with solemne purpose to observe<br/>
Immutably his sovran will, the end<br/>
Of what we are.  But since thou hast voutsaf’t<br/>
Gently for our instruction to impart<br/>
Things above Earthly thought, which yet concernd<br/>
Our knowing, as to highest wisdom seemd,<br/>
Deign to descend now lower, and relate<br/>
What may no less perhaps availe us known,<br/>
How first began this Heav’n which we behold<br/>
Distant so high, with moving Fires adornd<br/>
Innumerable, and this which yeelds or fills<br/>
All space, the ambient Aire wide interfus’d<br/>
Imbracing round this florid Earth, what cause<br/>
Mov’d the Creator in his holy Rest<br/>
Through all Eternitie so late to build<br/>
In <i>Chaos</i>, and the work begun, how soon<br/>
Absolv’d, if unforbid thou maist unfould<br/>
What wee, not to explore the secrets aske<br/>
Of his Eternal Empire, but the more<br/>
To magnifie his works, the more we know.<br/>
And the great Light of Day yet wants to run<br/>
Much of his Race though steep, suspens in Heav’n<br/>
Held by thy voice, thy potent voice he heares,<br/>
And longer will delay to heare thee tell<br/>
His Generation, and the rising Birth<br/>
Of Nature from the unapparent Deep:<br/>
Or if the Starr of Eevning and the Moon<br/>
Haste to thy audience, Night with her will bring<br/>
Silence, and Sleep listning to thee will watch,<br/>
Or we can bid his absence, till thy Song<br/>
End, and dismiss thee ere the Morning shine.<br/>
</p>
				<p class="poem">Thus <i>Adam</i> his illustrous Guest besought:</p>
				<p class="poem">And thus the Godlike Angel answerd milde.<br/>
This also thy request with caution askt<br/>
Obtaine: though to recount Almightie works<br/>
What words or tongue of Seraph can suffice,<br/>
Or heart of man suffice to comprehend?<br/>
Yet what thou canst attain, which best may serve<br/>
To glorifie the Maker, and inferr<br/>
Thee also happier, shall not be withheld<br/>
Thy hearing, such Commission from above<br/>
I have receav’d, to answer thy desire<br/>
Of knowledge within bounds; beyond abstain<br/>
To ask, nor let thine own inventions hope<br/>
Things not reveal’d, which th’ invisible King,<br/>
Onely Omniscient, hath supprest in Night,<br/>
To none communicable in Earth or Heaven:<br/>
Anough is left besides to search and know.<br/>
But Knowledge is as food, and needs no less<br/>
Her Temperance over Appetite, to know<br/>
In measure what the mind may well contain,<br/>
Oppresses else with Surfet, and soon turns<br/>
Wisdom to Folly, as Nourishment to Winde.<br/>
</p>
				<p class="poem">Know then, that after <i>Lucifer</i> from Heav’n<br/>
(So call him, brighter once amidst the Host<br/>
Of Angels, then that Starr the Starrs among)<br/>
Fell with his flaming Legions through the Deep<br/>
Into his place, and the great Son returnd<br/>
Victorious with his Saints, th’ Omnipotent<br/>
Eternal Father from his Throne beheld<br/>
Thir multitude, and to his Son thus spake.<br/>
</p>
				<p class="poem">At least our envious Foe hath fail’d, who thought<br/>
All like himself rebellious, by whose aid<br/>
This inaccessible high strength, the seat<br/>
Of Deitie supream, us dispossest,<br/>
He trusted to have seis’d, and into fraud<br/>
Drew many, whom thir place knows here no more;<br/>
Yet farr the greater part have kept, I see,<br/>
Thir station, Heav’n yet populous retaines<br/>
Number sufficient to possess her Realmes<br/>
Though wide, and this high Temple to frequent<br/>
With Ministeries due and solemn Rites:<br/>
But least his heart exalt him in the harme<br/>
Already done, to have dispeopl’d Heav’n,<br/>
My damage fondly deem’d, I can repaire<br/>
That detriment, if such it be to lose<br/>
Self-lost, and in a moment will create<br/>
Another World, out of one man a Race<br/>
Of men innumerable, there to dwell,<br/>
Not here, till by degrees of merit rais’d<br/>
They open to themselves at length the way<br/>
Up hither, under long obedience tri’d,<br/>
And Earth be chang’d to Heavn, &amp; Heav’n to Earth,<br/>
One Kingdom, Joy and Union without end.<br/>
Mean while inhabit laxe, ye Powers of Heav’n,<br/>
And thou my Word, begotten Son, by thee<br/>
This I perform, speak thou, and be it don:<br/>
My overshadowing Spirit and might with thee<br/>
I send along, ride forth, and bid the Deep<br/>
Within appointed bounds be Heav’n and Earth,<br/>
Boundless the Deep, because I am who fill<br/>
Infinitude, nor vacuous the space.<br/>
Though I uncircumscrib’d my self retire,<br/>
And put not forth my goodness, which is free<br/>
To act or not, Necessitie and Chance<br/>
Approach not mee, and what I will is Fate.<br/>
</p>
				<p class="poem">So spake th’ Almightie, and to what he spake<br/>
His Word, the Filial Godhead, gave effect.<br/>
Immediate are the Acts of God, more swift<br/>
Then time or motion, but to human ears<br/>
Cannot without process of speech be told,<br/>
So told as earthly notion can receave.<br/>
Great triumph and rejoycing was in Heav’n<br/>
When such was heard declar’d the Almightie’s will;<br/>
Glorie they sung to the most High, good will<br/>
To future men, and in thir dwellings peace:<br/>
Glorie to him whose just avenging ire<br/>
Had driven out th’ ungodly from his sight<br/>
And th’ habitations of the just; to him<br/>
Glorie and praise, whose wisdom had ordain’d<br/>
Good out of evil to create, in stead<br/>
Of Spirits maligne a better Race to bring<br/>
Into thir vacant room, and thence diffuse<br/>
His good to Worlds and Ages infinite.<br/>
So sang the Hierarchies: Mean while the Son<br/>
On his great Expedition now appeer’d,<br/>
Girt with Omnipotence, with Radiance crown’d<br/>
Of Majestie Divine, Sapience and Love<br/>
Immense, and all his Father in him shon.<br/>
About his Chariot numberless were pour’d<br/>
Cherub and Seraph, Potentates and Thrones,<br/>
And Vertues, winged Spirits, and Chariots wing’d,<br/>
From the Armoury of God, where stand of old<br/>
Myriads between two brazen Mountains lodg’d<br/>
Against a solemn day, harnest at hand,<br/>
Celestial Equipage; and now came forth<br/>
Spontaneous, for within them Spirit livd,<br/>
Attendant on thir Lord: Heav’n op’nd wide<br/>
Her ever during Gates, Harmonious sound<br/>
On golden Hinges moving, to let forth<br/>
The King of Glorie in his powerful Word<br/>
And Spirit coming to create new Worlds.<br/>
On heav’nly ground they stood, and from the shore<br/>
They view’d the vast immeasurable Abyss<br/>
Outrageous as a Sea, dark, wasteful, wilde,<br/>
Up from the bottom turn’d by furious windes<br/>
And surging waves, as Mountains to assault<br/>
Heav’ns highth, and with the Center mix the Pole.<br/>
</p>
				<p class="poem">Silence, ye troubl’d waves, and thou Deep, peace,<br/>
Said then th’ Omnific Word, your discord end:<br/>
</p>
				<p class="poem">Nor staid, but on the Wings of Cherubim<br/>
Uplifted, in Paternal Glorie rode<br/>
Farr into <i>Chaos</i>, and the World unborn;<br/>
For <i>Chaos</i> heard his voice: him all his Traine<br/>
Follow’d in bright procession to behold<br/>
Creation, and the wonders of his might.<br/>
Then staid the fervid Wheeles, and in his hand<br/>
He took the golden Compasses, prepar’d<br/>
In Gods Eternal store, to circumscribe<br/>
This Universe, and all created things:<br/>
One foot he center’d, and the other turn’d<br/>
Round through the vast profunditie obscure,<br/>
And said, thus farr extend, thus farr thy bounds,<br/>
This be thy just Circumference, O World.<br/>
Thus God the Heav’n created, thus the Earth,<br/>
Matter unform’d and void: Darkness profound<br/>
Cover’d th’ Abyss: but on the watrie calme<br/>
His brooding wings the Spirit of God outspred,<br/>
And vital vertue infus’d, and vital warmth<br/>
Throughout the fluid Mass, but downward purg’d<br/>
The black tartareous cold infernal dregs<br/>
Adverse to life: then founded, then conglob’d<br/>
Like things to like, the rest to several place<br/>
Disparted, and between spun out the Air,<br/>
And Earth self-ballanc’t on her Center hung.<br/>
</p>
				<p class="poem">Let ther be Light, said God, and forthwith Light<br/>
Ethereal, first of things, quintessence pure<br/>
Sprung from the Deep, and from her Native East<br/>
To journie through the airie gloom began,<br/>
Sphear’d in a radiant Cloud, for yet the Sun<br/>
Was not; shee in a cloudie Tabernacle<br/>
Sojourn’d the while.  God saw the Light was good;<br/>
And light from darkness by the Hemisphere<br/>
Divided: Light the Day, and Darkness Night<br/>
He nam’d.  Thus was the first Day Eev’n and Morn:<br/>
Nor past uncelebrated, nor unsung<br/>
By the Celestial Quires, when Orient Light<br/>
Exhaling first from Darkness they beheld;<br/>
Birth-day of Heav’n and Earth; with joy and shout<br/>
The hollow Universal Orb they fill’d,<br/>
And touch’t thir Golden Harps, &amp; hymning prais’d<br/>
God and his works, Creatour him they sung,<br/>
Both when first Eevning was, and when first Morn.<br/>
</p>
				<p class="poem">Again, God said, let ther be Firmament<br/>
Amid the Waters, and let it divide<br/>
The Waters from the Waters: and God made<br/>
The Firmament, expanse of liquid, pure,<br/>
Transparent, Elemental Air, diffus’d<br/>
In circuit to the uttermost convex<br/>
Of this great Round: partition firm and sure,<br/>
The Waters underneath from those above<br/>
Dividing: for as Earth, so hee the World<br/>
Built on circumfluous Waters calme, in wide<br/>
Crystallin Ocean, and the loud misrule<br/>
Of <i>Chaos</i> farr remov’d, least fierce extreames<br/>
Contiguous might distemper the whole frame:<br/>
And Heav’n he nam’d the Firmament: So Eev’n<br/>
And Morning <i>Chorus</i> sung the second Day.<br/>
</p>
				<p class="poem">The Earth was form’d, but in the Womb as yet<br/>
Of Waters, Embryon immature involv’d,<br/>
Appeer’d not: over all the face of Earth<br/>
Main Ocean flow’d, not idle, but with warme<br/>
Prolific humour soft’ning all her Globe,<br/>
Fermented the great Mother to conceave,<br/>
Satiate with genial moisture, when God said<br/>
Be gather’d now ye Waters under Heav’n<br/>
Into one place, and let dry Land appeer.<br/>
Immediately the Mountains huge appeer<br/>
Emergent, and thir broad bare backs upheave<br/>
Into the Clouds, thir tops ascend the Skie:<br/>
So high as heav’d the tumid Hills, so low<br/>
Down sunk a hollow bottom broad and deep,<br/>
Capacious bed of Waters: thither they<br/>
Hasted with glad precipitance, uprowld<br/>
As drops on dust conglobing from the drie;<br/>
Part rise in crystal Wall, or ridge direct,<br/>
For haste; such flight the great command impress’d<br/>
On the swift flouds: as Armies at the call<br/>
Of Trumpet (for of Armies thou hast heard)<br/>
Troop to thir Standard, so the watrie throng,<br/>
Wave rowling after Wave, where way they found,<br/>
If steep, with torrent rapture, if through Plaine,<br/>
Soft-ebbing; nor withstood them Rock or Hill,<br/>
But they, or under ground, or circuit wide<br/>
With Serpent errour wandring, found thir way,<br/>
And on the washie Oose deep Channels wore;<br/>
Easie, e’re God had bid the ground be drie,<br/>
All but within those banks, where Rivers now<br/>
Stream, and perpetual draw thir humid traine.<br/>
The dry Land, Earth, and the great receptacle<br/>
Of congregated Waters he call’d Seas:<br/>
And saw that it was good, and said, Let th’ Earth<br/>
Put forth the verdant Grass, Herb yeilding Seed,<br/>
And Fruit Tree yeilding Fruit after her kind;<br/>
Whose Seed is in her self upon the Earth.<br/>
He scarce had said, when the bare Earth, till then<br/>
Desert and bare, unsightly, unadorn’d,<br/>
Brought forth the tender Grass, whose verdure clad<br/>
Her Universal Face with pleasant green,<br/>
Then Herbs of every leaf, that sudden flour’d<br/>
Op’ning thir various colours, and made gay<br/>
Her bosom smelling sweet: and these scarce blown,<br/>
Forth flourish’t thick the clustring Vine, forth crept<br/>
The smelling Gourd, up stood the cornie Reed<br/>
Embattell’d in her field: add the humble Shrub,<br/>
And Bush with frizl’d hair implicit: last<br/>
Rose as in Dance the stately Trees, and spred<br/>
Thir branches hung with copious Fruit; or gemm’d<br/>
Thir Blossoms: with high Woods the Hills were crownd,<br/>
With tufts the vallies &amp; each fountain side,<br/>
With borders long the Rivers.  That Earth now<br/>
Seemd like to Heav’n, a seat where Gods might dwell,<br/>
Or wander with delight, and love to haunt<br/>
Her sacred shades: though God had yet not rain’d<br/>
Upon the Earth, and man to till the ground<br/>
None was, but from the Earth a dewie Mist<br/>
Went up and waterd all the ground, and each<br/>
Plant of the field, which e’re it was in the Earth<br/>
God made, and every Herb, before it grew<br/>
On the green stemm; God saw that it was good:<br/>
So Eev’n and Morn recorded the Third Day.<br/>
</p>
				<p class="poem">Again th’ Almightie spake: Let there be Lights<br/>
High in th’ expanse of Heaven to divide<br/>
The Day from Night; and let them be for Signes,<br/>
For Seasons, and for Dayes, and circling Years,<br/>
And let them be for Lights as I ordaine<br/>
Thir Office in the Firmament of Heav’n<br/>
To give Light on the Earth; and it was so.<br/>
And God made two great Lights, great for thir use<br/>
To Man, the greater to have rule by Day,<br/>
The less by Night alterne: and made the Starrs,<br/>
And set them in the Firmament of Heav’n<br/>
To illuminate the Earth, and rule the Day<br/>
In thir vicissitude, and rule the Night,<br/>
And Light from Darkness to divide.  God saw,<br/>
Surveying his great Work, that it was good:<br/>
For of Celestial Bodies first the Sun<br/>
A mightie Spheare he fram’d, unlightsom first,<br/>
Though of Ethereal Mould: then form’d the Moon<br/>
Globose, and everie magnitude of Starrs,<br/>
And sowd with Starrs the Heav’n thick as a field:<br/>
Of Light by farr the greater part he took,<br/>
Transplanted from her cloudie Shrine, and plac’d<br/>
In the Suns Orb, made porous to receive<br/>
And drink the liquid Light, firm to retaine<br/>
Her gather’d beams, great Palace now of Light.<br/>
Hither as to thir Fountain other Starrs<br/>
Repairing, in thir gold’n Urns draw Light,<br/>
And hence the Morning Planet guilds his horns;<br/>
By tincture or reflection they augment<br/>
Thir small peculiar, though from human sight<br/>
So farr remote, with diminution seen.<br/>
First in his East the glorious Lamp was seen,<br/>
Regent of Day, and all th’ Horizon round<br/>
Invested with bright Rayes, jocond to run<br/>
His Longitude through Heav’ns high rode: the gray<br/>
Dawn, and the <i>Pleiades</i> before him danc’d<br/>
Shedding sweet influence: less bright the Moon,<br/>
But opposite in leveld West was set<br/>
His mirror, with full face borrowing her Light<br/>
From him, for other light she needed none<br/>
In that aspect, and still that distance keepes<br/>
Till night, then in the East her turn she shines,<br/>
Revolvd on Heav’ns great Axle, and her Reign<br/>
With thousand lesser Lights dividual holds,<br/>
With thousand thousand Starres, that then appeer’d<br/>
Spangling the Hemisphere: then first adornd<br/>
With thir bright Luminaries that Set and Rose,<br/>
Glad Eevning &amp; glad Morn crownd the fourth day.<br/>
</p>
				<p class="poem">And God said, let the Waters generate<br/>
Reptil with Spawn abundant, living Soule:<br/>
And let Fowle flie above the Earth, with wings<br/>
Displayd on the op’n Firmament of Heav’n.<br/>
And God created the great Whales, and each<br/>
Soul living, each that crept, which plenteously<br/>
The waters generated by thir kindes,<br/>
And every Bird of wing after his kinde;<br/>
And saw that it was good, and bless’d them, saying,<br/>
Be fruitful, multiply, and in the Seas<br/>
And Lakes and running Streams the waters fill;<br/>
And let the Fowle be multiply’d on the Earth.<br/>
Forthwith the Sounds and Seas, each Creek &amp; Bay<br/>
With Frie innumerable swarme, and Shoales<br/>
Of Fish that with thir Finns and shining Scales<br/>
Glide under the green Wave, in Sculles that oft<br/>
Bank the mid Sea: part single or with mate<br/>
Graze the Sea weed thir pasture, &amp; through Groves<br/>
Of Coral stray, or sporting with quick glance<br/>
Show to the Sun thir wav’d coats dropt with Gold,<br/>
Or in thir Pearlie shells at ease, attend<br/>
Moist nutriment, or under Rocks thir food<br/>
In jointed Armour watch: on smooth the Seale,<br/>
And bended Dolphins play: part huge of bulk<br/>
Wallowing unweildie, enormous in thir Gate<br/>
Tempest the Ocean: there Leviathan<br/>
Hugest of living Creatures, on the Deep<br/>
Stretcht like a Promontorie sleeps or swimmes,<br/>
And seems a moving Land, and at his Gilles<br/>
Draws in, and at his Trunck spouts out a Sea.<br/>
Mean while the tepid Caves, and Fens and shoares<br/>
Thir Brood as numerous hatch, from the Egg that soon<br/>
Bursting with kindly rupture forth disclos’d<br/>
Thir callow young, but featherd soon and fledge<br/>
They summ’d thir Penns, and soaring th’ air sublime<br/>
With clang despis’d the ground, under a cloud<br/>
In prospect; there the Eagle and the Stork<br/>
On Cliffs and Cedar tops thir Eyries build:<br/>
Part loosly wing the Region, part more wise<br/>
In common, rang’d in figure wedge thir way,<br/>
Intelligent of seasons, and set forth<br/>
Thir Aierie Caravan high over Sea’s<br/>
Flying, and over Lands with mutual wing<br/>
Easing thir flight; so stears the prudent Crane<br/>
Her annual Voiage, born on Windes; the Aire<br/>
Floats, as they pass, fann’d with unnumber’d plumes:<br/>
From Branch to Branch the smaller Birds with song<br/>
Solac’d the Woods, and spred thir painted wings<br/>
Till Ev’n, nor then the solemn Nightingal<br/>
Ceas’d warbling, but all night tun’d her soft layes:<br/>
Others on Silver Lakes and Rivers Bath’d<br/>
Thir downie Brest; the Swan with Arched neck<br/>
Between her white wings mantling proudly, Rowes<br/>
Her state with Oarie feet: yet oft they quit<br/>
The Dank, and rising on stiff Pennons, towre<br/>
The mid Aereal Skie: Others on ground<br/>
Walk’d firm; the crested Cock whose clarion sounds<br/>
The silent hours, and th’ other whose gay Traine<br/>
Adorns him, colour’d with the Florid hue<br/>
Of Rainbows and Starrie Eyes.  The Waters thus<br/>
With Fish replenisht, and the Aire with Fowle,<br/>
Ev’ning and Morn solemniz’d the Fift day.<br/>
</p>
				<p class="poem">The Sixt, and of Creation last arose<br/>
With Eevning Harps and Mattin, when God said,<br/>
Let th’ Earth bring forth Fowle living in her kinde,<br/>
Cattel and Creeping things, and Beast of the Earth,<br/>
Each in their kinde.  The Earth obey’d, and strait<br/>
Op’ning her fertil Woomb teem’d at a Birth<br/>
Innumerous living Creatures, perfet formes,<br/>
Limb’d and full grown: out of the ground up-rose<br/>
As from his Laire the wilde Beast where he wonns<br/>
In Forrest wilde, in Thicket, Brake, or Den;<br/>
Among the Trees in Pairs they rose, they walk’d:<br/>
The Cattel in the Fields and Meddowes green:<br/>
Those rare and solitarie, these in flocks<br/>
Pasturing at once, and in broad Herds upsprung:<br/>
The grassie Clods now Calv’d, now half appeer’d<br/>
The Tawnie Lion, pawing to get free<br/>
His hinder parts, then springs as broke from Bonds,<br/>
And Rampant shakes his Brinded main; the Ounce,<br/>
The Libbard, and the Tyger, as the Moale<br/>
Rising, the crumbl’d Earth above them threw<br/>
In Hillocks; the swift Stag from under ground<br/>
Bore up his branching head: scarse from his mould<br/>
<i>Behemoth</i> biggest born of Earth upheav’d<br/>
His vastness: Fleec’t the Flocks and bleating rose,<br/>
As Plants: ambiguous between Sea and Land<br/>
The River Horse and scalie Crocodile.<br/>
At once came forth whatever creeps the ground,<br/>
Insect or Worme; those wav’d thir limber fans<br/>
For wings, and smallest Lineaments exact<br/>
In all the Liveries dect of Summers pride<br/>
With spots of Gold and Purple, azure and green:<br/>
These as a line thir long dimension drew,<br/>
Streaking the ground with sinuous trace; not all<br/>
Minims of Nature; some of Serpent kinde<br/>
Wondrous in length and corpulence involv’d<br/>
Thir Snakie foulds, and added wings.  First crept<br/>
The Parsimonious Emmet, provident<br/>
Of future, in small room large heart enclos’d,<br/>
Pattern of just equalitie perhaps<br/>
Hereafter, join’d in her popular Tribes<br/>
Of Commonaltie: swarming next appeer’d<br/>
The Femal Bee that feeds her Husband Drone<br/>
Deliciously, and builds her waxen Cells<br/>
With Honey stor’d: the rest are numberless,<br/>
And thou thir Natures know’st, and gav’st them Names,<br/>
Needlest to thee repeaed; nor unknown<br/>
The Serpent suttl’st Beast of all the field,<br/>
Of huge extent somtimes, with brazen Eyes<br/>
And hairie Main terrific, though to thee<br/>
Not noxious, but obedient at thy call.<br/>
Now Heav’n in all her Glorie shon, and rowld<br/>
Her motions, as the great first-Movers hand<br/>
First wheeld thir course; Earth in her rich attire<br/>
Consummate lovly smil’d; Aire, Water, Earth,<br/>
By Fowl, Fish, Beast, was flown, was swum, was walkt<br/>
Frequent; and of the Sixt day yet remain’d;<br/>
There wanted yet the Master work, the end<br/>
Of all yet don; a Creature who not prone<br/>
And Brute as other Creatures, but endu’d<br/>
With Sanctitie of Reason, might erect<br/>
His Stature, and upright with Front serene<br/>
Govern the rest, self-knowing, and from thence<br/>
Magnanimous to correspond with Heav’n,<br/>
But grateful to acknowledge whence his good<br/>
Descends, thither with heart and voice and eyes<br/>
Directed in Devotion, to adore<br/>
And worship God Supream, who made him chief<br/>
Of all his works: therefore the Omnipotent<br/>
Eternal Father (For where is not hee<br/>
Present) thus to his Son audibly spake.<br/>
</p>
				<p class="poem">Let us make now Man in our image, Man<br/>
In our similitude, and let them rule<br/>
Over the Fish and Fowle of Sea and Aire,<br/>
Beast of the Field, and over all the Earth,<br/>
And every creeping thing that creeps the ground.<br/>
This said, he formd thee, <i>Adam</i>, thee O Man<br/>
Dust of the ground, and in thy nostrils breath’d<br/>
The breath of Life; in his own Image hee<br/>
Created thee, in the Image of God<br/>
Express, and thou becam’st a living Soul.<br/>
Male he created thee, but thy consort<br/>
Femal for Race; then bless’d Mankinde, and said,<br/>
Be fruitful, multiplie, and fill the Earth,<br/>
Subdue it, and throughout Dominion hold<br/>
Over Fish of the Sea, and Fowle of the Aire,<br/>
And every living thing that moves on the Earth.<br/>
Wherever thus created, for no place<br/>
Is yet distinct by name, thence, as thou know’st<br/>
He brought thee into this delicious Grove,<br/>
This Garden, planted with the Trees of God,<br/>
Delectable both to behold and taste;<br/>
And freely all thir pleasant fruit for food<br/>
Gave thee, all sorts are here that all th’ Earth yeelds,<br/>
Varietie without end; but of the Tree<br/>
Which tasted works knowledge of Good and Evil,<br/>
Thou mai’st not; in the day thou eat’st, thou di’st;<br/>
Death is the penaltie impos’d, beware,<br/>
And govern well thy appetite, least sin<br/>
Surprise thee, and her black attendant Death.<br/>
Here finish’d hee, and all that he had made<br/>
View’d, and behold all was entirely good;<br/>
So Ev’n and Morn accomplish’d the Sixt day:<br/>
Yet not till the Creator from his work<br/>
Desisting, though unwearied, up returnd<br/>
Up to the Heav’n of Heav’ns his high abode,<br/>
Thence to behold this new created World<br/>
Th’ addition of his Empire, how it shew’d<br/>
In prospect from his Throne, how good, how faire,<br/>
Answering his great Idea.  Up he rode<br/>
Followd with acclamation and the sound<br/>
Symphonious of ten thousand Harpes that tun’d<br/>
Angelic harmonies: the Earth, the Aire<br/>
Resounded, (thou remember’st, for thou heardst)<br/>
The Heav’ns and all the Constellations rung,<br/>
The Planets in thir stations list’ning stood,<br/>
While the bright Pomp ascended jubilant.<br/>
Open, ye everlasting Gates, they sung,<br/>
Open, ye Heav’ns, your living dores; let in<br/>
The great Creator from his work returnd<br/>
Magnificent, his Six days work, a World;<br/>
Open, and henceforth oft; for God will deigne<br/>
To visit oft the dwellings of just Men<br/>
Delighted, and with frequent intercourse<br/>
Thither will send his winged Messengers<br/>
On errands of supernal Grace.  So sung<br/>
The glorious Train ascending: He through Heav’n,<br/>
That open’d wide her blazing Portals, led<br/>
To Gods Eternal house direct the way,<br/>
A broad and ample rode, whose dust is Gold<br/>
And pavement Starrs, as Starrs to thee appeer,<br/>
Seen in the Galaxie, that Milkie way<br/>
Which nightly as a circling Zone thou seest<br/>
Pouderd with Starrs.  And now on Earth the Seaventh<br/>
Eev’ning arose in <i>Eden</i>, for the Sun<br/>
Was set, and twilight from the East came on,<br/>
Forerunning Night; when at the holy mount<br/>
Of Heav’ns high-seated top, th’ Impereal Throne<br/>
Of Godhead, fixt for ever firm and sure,<br/>
The Filial Power arriv’d, and sate him down<br/>
With his great Father (for he also went<br/>
Invisible, yet staid (such priviledge<br/>
Hath Omnipresence) and the work ordain’d,<br/>
Author and end of all things, and from work<br/>
Now resting, bless’d and hallowd the Seav’nth day,<br/>
As resting on that day from all his work,<br/>
But not in silence holy kept; the Harp<br/>
Had work and rested not, the solemn Pipe,<br/>
And Dulcimer, all Organs of sweet stop,<br/>
All sounds on Fret by String or Golden Wire<br/>
Temper’d soft Tunings, intermixt with Voice<br/>
Choral or Unison: of incense Clouds<br/>
Fuming from Golden Censers hid the Mount.<br/>
Creation and the Six dayes acts they sung,<br/>
Great are thy works, <i>Jehovah</i>, infinite<br/>
Thy power; what thought can measure thee or tongue<br/>
Relate thee; greater now in thy return<br/>
Then from the Giant Angels; thee that day<br/>
Thy Thunders magnifi’d; but to create<br/>
Is greater then created to destroy.<br/>
Who can impair thee, mighty King, or bound<br/>
Thy Empire? easily the proud attempt<br/>
Of Spirits apostat and thir Counsels vaine<br/>
Thou hast repeld, while impiously they thought<br/>
Thee to diminish, and from thee withdraw<br/>
The number of thy worshippers.  Who seekes<br/>
To lessen thee, against his purpose serves<br/>
To manifest the more thy might: his evil<br/>
Thou usest, and from thence creat’st more good.<br/>
Witness this new-made World, another Heav’n<br/>
From Heaven Gate not farr, founded in view<br/>
On the cleer <i>Hyaline</i>, the Glassie Sea;<br/>
Of amplitude almost immense, with Starr’s<br/>
Numerous, and every Starr perhaps a World<br/>
Of destind habitation; but thou know’st<br/>
Thir seasons: among these the seat of men,<br/>
Earth with her nether Ocean circumfus’d,<br/>
Thir pleasant dwelling place.  Thrice happie men,<br/>
And sons of men, whom God hath thus advanc’t,<br/>
Created in his Image, there to dwell<br/>
And worship him, and in reward to rule<br/>
Over his Works, on Earth, in Sea, or Air,<br/>
And multiply a Race of Worshippers<br/>
Holy and just: thrice happie if they know<br/>
Thir happiness, and persevere upright.<br/>
</p>
				<p class="poem">So sung they, and the Empyrean rung,<br/>
With <i>Halleluiahs</i>: Thus was Sabbath kept.<br/>
And thy request think now fulfill’d, that ask’d<br/>
How first this World and face of things began,<br/>
And what before thy memorie was don<br/>
From the beginning, that posteritie<br/>
Informd by thee might know; if else thou seekst<br/>
Aught, not surpassing human measure, say.<br/>
</p>
				<p class="poem">To whom thus <i>Adam</i> gratefully repli’d.<br/>
What thanks sufficient, or what recompence<br/>
Equal have I to render thee, Divine<br/>
Hystorian, who thus largely hast allayd<br/>
The thirst I had of knowledge, and voutsaf’t<br/>
This friendly condescention to relate<br/>
Things else by me unsearchable, now heard<br/>
VVith wonder, but delight, and, as is due,<br/>
With glorie attributed to the high<br/>
Creator; some thing yet of doubt remaines,<br/>
VVhich onely thy solution can resolve.<br/>
VVhen I behold this goodly Frame, this VVorld<br/>
Of Heav’n and Earth consisting, and compute,<br/>
Thir magnitudes, this Earth a spot, a graine,<br/>
An Atom, with the Firmament compar’d<br/>
And all her numberd Starrs, that seem to rowle<br/>
Spaces incomprehensible (for such<br/>
Thir distance argues and thir swift return<br/>
Diurnal) meerly to officiate light<br/>
Round this opacous Earth, this punctual spot,<br/>
One day and night; in all thir vast survey<br/>
Useless besides, reasoning I oft admire,<br/>
How Nature wise and frugal could commit<br/>
Such disproportions, with superfluous hand<br/>
So many nobler Bodies to create,<br/>
Greater so manifold to this one use,<br/>
For aught appeers, and on thir Orbs impose<br/>
Such restless revolution day by day<br/>
Repeated, while the sedentarie Earth,<br/>
That better might with farr less compass move,<br/>
Serv’d by more noble then her self, attaines<br/>
Her end without least motion, and receaves,<br/>
As Tribute such a sumless journey brought<br/>
Of incorporeal speed, her warmth and light;<br/>
Speed, to describe whose swiftness Number failes.<br/>
</p>
				<p class="poem">So spake our Sire, and by his count’nance seemd<br/>
Entring on studious thoughts abstruse, which <i>Eve</i><br/>
Perceaving where she sat retir’d in sight,<br/>
With lowliness Majestic from her seat,<br/>
And Grace that won who saw to wish her stay,<br/>
Rose, and went forth among her Fruits and Flours,<br/>
To visit how they prosper’d, bud and bloom,<br/>
Her Nurserie; they at her coming sprung<br/>
And toucht by her fair tendance gladlier grew.<br/>
Yet went she not, as not with such discourse<br/>
Delighted, or not capable her eare<br/>
Of what was high: such pleasure she reserv’d,<br/>
<i>Adam</i> relating, she sole Auditress;<br/>
Her Husband the Relater she preferr’d<br/>
Before the Angel, and of him to ask<br/>
Chose rather; hee, she knew would intermix<br/>
Grateful digressions, and solve high dispute<br/>
With conjugal Caresses, from his Lip<br/>
Not Words alone pleas’d her.  O when meet now<br/>
Such pairs, in Love and mutual Honour joyn’d?<br/>
With Goddess-like demeanour forth she went;<br/>
Not unattended, for on her as Queen<br/>
A pomp of winning Graces waited still,<br/>
And from about her shot Darts of desire<br/>
Into all Eyes to wish her still in sight.<br/>
And <i>Raphael</i> now to <i>Adam</i>’s doubt propos’d<br/>
Benevolent and facil thus repli’d.<br/>
</p>
				<p class="poem">To ask or search I blame thee not, for Heav’n<br/>
Is as the Book of God before thee set,<br/>
Wherein to read his wondrous Works, and learne<br/>
His Seasons, Hours, or Days, or Months, or Yeares:<br/>
This to attain, whether Heav’n move or Earth,<br/>
Imports not, if thou reck’n right, the rest<br/>
From Man or Angel the great Architect<br/>
Did wisely to conceal, and not divulge<br/>
His secrets to be scann’d by them who ought<br/>
Rather admire; or if they list to try<br/>
Conjecture, he his Fabric of the Heav’ns<br/>
Hath left to thir disputes, perhaps to move<br/>
His laughter at thir quaint Opinions wide<br/>
Hereafter, when they come to model Heav’n<br/>
And calculate the Starrs, how they will weild<br/>
The mightie frame, how build, unbuild, contrive<br/>
To save appeerances, how gird the Sphear<br/>
With Centric and Eccentric scribl’d o’re,<br/>
Cycle and Epicycle, Orb in Orb:<br/>
Alreadie by thy reasoning this I guess,<br/>
Who art to lead thy ofspring, and supposest<br/>
That Bodies bright and greater should not serve<br/>
The less not bright, nor Heav’n such journies run,<br/>
Earth sitting still, when she alone receaves<br/>
The benefit: consider first, that Great<br/>
Or Bright inferrs not Excellence: the Earth<br/>
Though, in comparison of Heav’n, so small,<br/>
Nor glistering, may of solid good containe<br/>
More plenty then the Sun that barren shines,<br/>
Whose vertue on it self workes no effect,<br/>
But in the fruitful Earth; there first receavd<br/>
His beams, unactive else, thir vigor find.<br/>
Yet not to Earth are those bright Luminaries<br/>
Officious, but to thee Earths habitant.<br/>
And for the Heav’ns wide Circuit, let it speak<br/>
The Makers high magnificence, who built<br/>
So spacious, and his Line stretcht out so farr;<br/>
That Man may know he dwells not in his own;<br/>
An Edifice too large for him to fill,<br/>
Lodg’d in a small partition, and the rest<br/>
Ordain’d for uses to his Lord best known.<br/>
The swiftness of those Circles attribute,<br/>
Though numberless, to his Omnipotence,<br/>
That to corporeal substances could adde<br/>
Speed almost Spiritual; mee thou thinkst not slow,<br/>
Who since the Morning hour set out from Heav’n<br/>
Where God resides, and ere mid-day arriv’d<br/>
In <i>Eden</i>, distance inexpressible<br/>
By Numbers that have name.  But this I urge,<br/>
Admitting Motion in the Heav’ns, to shew<br/>
Invalid that which thee to doubt it mov’d;<br/>
Not that I so affirm, though so it seem<br/>
To thee who hast thy dwelling here on Earth.<br/>
God to remove his wayes from human sense,<br/>
Plac’d Heav’n from Earth so farr, that earthly sight,<br/>
If it presume, might erre in things too high,<br/>
And no advantage gaine.  What if the Sun<br/>
Be Center to the World, and other Starrs<br/>
By his attractive vertue and thir own<br/>
Incited, dance about him various rounds?<br/>
Thir wandring course now high, now low, then hid,<br/>
Progressive, retrograde, or standing still,<br/>
In six thou seest, and what if sev’nth to these<br/>
The Planet Earth, so stedfast though she seem,<br/>
Insensibly three different Motions move?<br/>
Which else to several Sphears thou must ascribe,<br/>
Mov’d contrarie with thwart obliquities,<br/>
Or save the Sun his labour, and that swift<br/>
Nocturnal and Diurnal rhomb suppos’d,<br/>
Invisible else above all Starrs, the Wheele<br/>
Of Day and Night; which needs not thy beleefe,<br/>
If Earth industrious of her self fetch Day<br/>
Travelling East, and with her part averse<br/>
From the Suns beam meet Night, her other part<br/>
Still luminous by his ray.  What if that light<br/>
Sent from her through the wide transpicuous aire,<br/>
To the terrestrial Moon be as a Starr<br/>
Enlightning her by Day, as she by Night<br/>
This Earth? reciprocal, if Land be there,<br/>
Feilds and Inhabitants: Her spots thou seest<br/>
As Clouds, and Clouds may rain, and Rain produce<br/>
Fruits in her soft’nd Soile, for some to eate<br/>
Allotted there; and other Suns perhaps<br/>
With thir attendant Moons thou wilt descrie<br/>
Communicating Male and Femal Light,<br/>
Which two great Sexes animate the World,<br/>
Stor’d in each Orb perhaps with some that live.<br/>
For such vast room in Nature unpossest<br/>
By living Soule, desert and desolate,<br/>
Onely to shine, yet scarce to contribute<br/>
Each Orb a glimps of Light, conveyd so farr<br/>
Down to this habitable, which returnes<br/>
Light back to them, is obvious to dispute.<br/>
But whether thus these things, or whether not,<br/>
Whether the Sun predominant in Heav’n<br/>
Rise on the Earth, or Earth rise on the Sun,<br/>
Hee from the East his flaming rode begin,<br/>
Or Shee from West her silent course advance<br/>
With inoffensive pace that spinning sleeps<br/>
On her soft Axle, while she paces Eev’n,<br/>
And bears thee soft with the smooth Air along,<br/>
Sollicit not thy thoughts with matters hid,<br/>
Leave them to God above, him serve and feare;<br/>
Of other Creatures, as him pleases best,<br/>
Wherever plac’t, let him dispose: joy thou<br/>
In what he gives to thee, this Paradise<br/>
And thy faire <i>Eve</i>; Heav’n is for thee too high<br/>
To know what passes there; be lowlie wise:<br/>
Think onely what concernes thee and thy being;<br/>
Dream not of other Worlds, what Creatures there<br/>
Live, in what state, condition or degree,<br/>
Contented that thus farr hath been reveal’d<br/>
Not of Earth onely but of highest Heav’n.<br/>
</p>
				<p class="poem">To whom thus <i>Adam</i> cleerd of doubt, repli’d.<br/>
How fully hast thou satisfi’d mee, pure<br/>
Intelligence of Heav’n, Angel serene,<br/>
And freed from intricacies, taught to live,<br/>
The easiest way, nor with perplexing thoughts<br/>
To interrupt the sweet of Life, from which<br/>
God hath bid dwell farr off all anxious cares,<br/>
And not molest us, unless we our selves<br/>
Seek them with wandring thoughts, and notions vaine.<br/>
But apt the Mind or Fancie is to roave<br/>
Uncheckt, and of her roaving is no end;<br/>
Till warn’d, or by experience taught, she learne,<br/>
That not to know at large of things remote<br/>
From use, obscure and suttle, but to know<br/>
That which before us lies in daily life,<br/>
Is the prime Wisdom, what is more, is fume,<br/>
Or emptiness, or fond impertinence,<br/>
And renders us in things that most concerne<br/>
Unpractis’d, unprepar’d, and still to seek.<br/>
Therefore from this high pitch let us descend<br/>
A lower flight, and speak of things at hand<br/>
Useful, whence haply mention may arise<br/>
Of somthing not unseasonable to ask<br/>
By sufferance, and thy wonted favour deign’d.<br/>
Thee I have heard relating what was don<br/>
Ere my remembrance: now hear mee relate<br/>
My Storie, which perhaps thou hast not heard;<br/>
And Day is yet not spent; till then thou seest<br/>
How suttly to detaine thee I devise,<br/>
Inviting thee to hear while I relate,<br/>
Fond, were it not in hope of thy reply:<br/>
For while I sit with thee, I seem in Heav’n,<br/>
And sweeter thy discourse is to my eare<br/>
Then Fruits of Palm-tree pleasantest to thirst<br/>
And hunger both, from labour, at the houre<br/>
Of sweet repast; they satiate, and soon fill,<br/>
Though pleasant, but thy words with Grace Divine<br/>
Imbu’d, bring to thir sweetness no satietie.<br/>
</p>
				<p class="poem">To whom thus <i>Raphael</i> answer’d heav’nly meek.<br/>
Nor are thy lips ungraceful, Sire of men,<br/>
Nor tongue ineloquent; for God on thee<br/>
Abundantly his gifts hath also pour’d,<br/>
Inward and outward both, his image faire:<br/>
Speaking or mute all comliness and grace<br/>
Attends thee, and each word, each motion formes.<br/>
Nor less think wee in Heav’n of thee on Earth<br/>
Then of our fellow servant, and inquire<br/>
Gladly into the wayes of God with Man:<br/>
For God we see hath honour’d thee, and set<br/>
On Man his equal Love: say therefore on;<br/>
For I that Day was absent, as befell,<br/>
Bound on a voyage uncouth and obscure,<br/>
Farr on excursion toward the Gates of Hell;<br/>
Squar’d in full Legion (such command we had)<br/>
To see that none thence issu’d forth a spie,<br/>
Or enemie, while God was in his work,<br/>
Least hee incenst at such eruption bold,<br/>
Destruction with Creation might have mixt.<br/>
Not that they durst without his leave attempt,<br/>
But us he sends upon his high behests<br/>
For state, as Sovran King, and to enure<br/>
Our prompt obedience.  Fast we found, fast shut<br/>
The dismal Gates, and barricado’d strong;<br/>
But long ere our approaching heard within<br/>
Noise, other then the sound of Dance or Song,<br/>
Torment, and lowd lament, and furious rage.<br/>
Glad we return’d up to the coasts of Light<br/>
Ere Sabbath Eev’ning: so we had in charge.<br/>
But thy relation now; for I attend,<br/>
Pleas’d with thy words no less then thou with mine.<br/>
</p>
				<p class="poem">So spake the Godlike Power, and thus our Sire.<br/>
For Man to tell how human Life began<br/>
Is hard; for who himself beginning knew?<br/>
Desire with thee still longer to converse<br/>
Induc’d me.  As new wak’t from soundest sleep<br/>
Soft on the flourie herb I found me laid<br/>
In Balmie Sweat, which with his Beames the Sun<br/>
Soon dri’d, and on the reaking moisture fed.<br/>
Strait toward Heav’n my wondring Eyes I turnd,<br/>
And gaz’d a while the ample Skie, till rais’d<br/>
By quick instinctive motion up I sprung,<br/>
As thitherward endevoring, and upright<br/>
Stood on my feet; about me round I saw<br/>
Hill, Dale, and shadie Woods, and sunnie Plaines,<br/>
And liquid Lapse of murmuring Streams; by these,<br/>
Creatures that livd, and movd, and walk’d, or flew,<br/>
Birds on the branches warbling; all things smil’d,<br/>
With fragrance and with joy my heart oreflow’d.<br/>
My self I then perus’d, and Limb by Limb<br/>
Survey’d, and sometimes went, and sometimes ran<br/>
With supple joints, as lively vigour led:<br/>
But who I was, or where, or from what cause,<br/>
Knew not; to speak I tri’d, and forthwith spake,<br/>
My Tongue obey’d and readily could name<br/>
What e’re I saw.  Thou Sun, said I, faire Light,<br/>
And thou enlight’nd Earth, so fresh and gay,<br/>
Ye Hills and Dales, ye Rivers, Woods, and Plaines,<br/>
And ye that live and move, fair Creatures, tell,<br/>
Tell, if ye saw, how came I thus, how here?<br/>
Not of my self; by some great Maker then,<br/>
In goodness and in power praeeminent;<br/>
Tell me, how may I know him, how adore,<br/>
From whom I have that thus I move and live,<br/>
And feel that I am happier then I know.<br/>
While thus I call’d, and stray’d I knew not whither,<br/>
From where I first drew Aire, and first beheld<br/>
This happie Light, when answer none return’d,<br/>
On a green shadie Bank profuse of Flours<br/>
Pensive I sate me down; there gentle sleep<br/>
First found me, and with soft oppression seis’d<br/>
My droused sense, untroubl’d, though I thought<br/>
I then was passing to my former state<br/>
Insensible, and forthwith to dissolve:<br/>
When suddenly stood at my Head a dream,<br/>
Whose inward apparition gently mov’d<br/>
My Fancy to believe I yet had being,<br/>
And livd: One came, methought, of shape Divine,<br/>
And said, thy Mansion wants thee, <i>Adam</i>, rise,<br/>
First Man, of Men innumerable ordain’d<br/>
First Father, call’d by thee I come thy Guide<br/>
To the Garden of bliss, thy seat prepar’d.<br/>
So saying, by the hand he took me rais’d,<br/>
And over Fields and Waters, as in Aire<br/>
Smooth sliding without step, last led me up<br/>
A woodie Mountain; whose high top was plaine,<br/>
A Circuit wide, enclos’d, with goodliest Trees<br/>
Planted, with Walks, and Bowers, that what I saw<br/>
Of Earth before scarse pleasant seemd.  Each Tree<br/>
Load’n with fairest Fruit, that hung to the Eye<br/>
Tempting, stirr’d in me sudden appetite<br/>
To pluck and eate; whereat I wak’d, and found<br/>
Before mine Eyes all real, as the dream<br/>
Had lively shadowd: Here had new begun<br/>
My wandring, had not hee who was my Guide<br/>
Up hither, from among the Trees appeer’d,<br/>
Presence Divine.  Rejoycing, but with aw<br/>
In adoration at his feet I fell<br/>
Submiss: he rear’d me, &amp; Whom thou soughtst I am,<br/>
Said mildely, Author of all this thou seest<br/>
Above, or round about thee or beneath.<br/>
This Paradise I give thee, count it thine<br/>
To Till and keep, and of the Fruit to eate:<br/>
Of every Tree that in the Garden growes<br/>
Eate freely with glad heart; fear here no dearth:<br/>
But of the Tree whose operation brings<br/>
Knowledg of good and ill, which I have set<br/>
The Pledge of thy Obedience and thy Faith,<br/>
Amid the Garden by the Tree of Life,<br/>
Remember what I warne thee, shun to taste,<br/>
And shun the bitter consequence: for know,<br/>
The day thou eat’st thereof, my sole command<br/>
Transgrest, inevitably thou shalt dye;<br/>
From that day mortal, and this happie State<br/>
Shalt loose, expell’d from hence into a World<br/>
Of woe and sorrow.  Sternly he pronounc’d<br/>
The rigid interdiction, which resounds<br/>
Yet dreadful in mine eare, though in my choice<br/>
Not to incur; but soon his cleer aspect<br/>
Return’d and gratious purpose thus renew’d.<br/>
Not onely these fair bounds, but all the Earth<br/>
To thee and to thy Race I give; as Lords<br/>
Possess it, and all things that therein live,<br/>
Or live in Sea, or Aire, Beast, Fish, and Fowle.<br/>
In signe whereof each Bird and Beast behold<br/>
After thir kindes; I bring them to receave<br/>
From thee thir Names, and pay thee fealtie<br/>
With low subjection; understand the same<br/>
Of Fish within thir watry residence,<br/>
Not hither summond, since they cannot change<br/>
Thir Element to draw the thinner Aire.<br/>
As thus he spake, each Bird and Beast behold<br/>
Approaching two and two, These cowring low<br/>
With blandishment, each Bird stoop’d on his wing.<br/>
I nam’d them, as they pass’d, and understood<br/>
Thir Nature, with such knowledg God endu’d<br/>
My sudden apprehension: but in these<br/>
I found not what me thought I wanted still;<br/>
And to the Heav’nly vision thus presum’d.<br/>
</p>
				<p class="poem">O by what Name, for thou above all these,<br/>
Above mankinde, or aught then mankinde higher,<br/>
Surpassest farr my naming, how may I<br/>
Adore thee, Author of this Universe,<br/>
And all this good to man, for whose well being<br/>
So amply, and with hands so liberal<br/>
Thou hast provided all things: but with mee<br/>
I see not who partakes.  In solitude<br/>
What happiness, who can enjoy alone,<br/>
Or all enjoying, what contentment find?<br/>
Thus I presumptuous; and the vision bright,<br/>
As with a smile more bright’nd, thus repli’d.<br/>
</p>
				<p class="poem">What call’st thou solitude, is not the Earth<br/>
With various living creatures, and the Aire<br/>
Replenisht, and all these at thy command<br/>
To come and play before thee, know’st thou not<br/>
Thir language and thir wayes, they also know,<br/>
And reason not contemptibly; with these<br/>
Find pastime, and beare rule; thy Realm is large.<br/>
So spake the Universal Lord, and seem’d<br/>
So ordering.  I with leave of speech implor’d,<br/>
And humble deprecation thus repli’d.<br/>
</p>
				<p class="poem">Let not my words offend thee, Heav’nly Power,<br/>
My Maker, be propitious while I speak.<br/>
Hast thou not made me here thy substitute,<br/>
And these inferiour farr beneath me set?<br/>
Among unequals what societie<br/>
Can sort, what harmonie or true delight?<br/>
Which must be mutual, in proportion due<br/>
Giv’n and receiv’d; but in disparitie<br/>
The one intense, the other still remiss<br/>
Cannot well suite with either, but soon prove<br/>
Tedious alike: Of fellowship I speak<br/>
Such as I seek, fit to participate<br/>
All rational delight, wherein the brute<br/>
Cannot be human consort; they rejoyce<br/>
Each with thir kinde, Lion with Lioness;<br/>
So fitly them in pairs thou hast combin’d;<br/>
Much less can Bird with Beast, or Fish with Fowle<br/>
So well converse, nor with the Ox the Ape;<br/>
Wors then can Man with Beast, and least of all.<br/>
</p>
				<p class="poem">Whereto th’ Almighty answer’d, not displeas’d.<br/>
A nice and suttle happiness I see<br/>
Thou to thy self proposest, in the choice<br/>
Of thy Associates, <i>Adam</i>, and wilt taste<br/>
No pleasure, though in pleasure, solitarie.<br/>
What thinkst thou then of mee, and this my State,<br/>
Seem I to thee sufficiently possest<br/>
Of happiness, or not? who am alone<br/>
From all Eternitie, for none I know<br/>
Second to mee or like, equal much less.<br/>
How have I then with whom to hold converse<br/>
Save with the Creatures which I made, and those<br/>
To me inferiour, infinite descents<br/>
Beneath what other Creatures are to thee?<br/>
</p>
				<p class="poem">He ceas’d, I lowly answer’d.  To attaine<br/>
The highth and depth of thy Eternal wayes<br/>
All human thoughts come short, Supream of things;<br/>
Thou in thy self art perfet, and in thee<br/>
Is no deficience found; not so is Man,<br/>
But in degree, the cause of his desire<br/>
By conversation with his like to help,<br/>
Or solace his defects.  No need that thou<br/>
Shouldst propagat, already infinite;<br/>
And through all numbers absolute, though One;<br/>
But Man by number is to manifest<br/>
His single imperfection, and beget<br/>
Like of his like, his Image multipli’d,<br/>
In unitie defective, which requires<br/>
Collateral love, and deerest amitie.<br/>
Thou in thy secresie although alone,<br/>
Best with thy self accompanied, seek’st not<br/>
Social communication, yet so pleas’d,<br/>
Canst raise thy Creature to what highth thou wilt<br/>
Of Union or Communion, deifi’d;<br/>
I by conversing cannot these erect<br/>
From prone, nor in thir wayes complacence find.<br/>
Thus I embold’nd spake, and freedom us’d<br/>
Permissive, and acceptance found, which gain’d<br/>
This answer from the gratious voice Divine.<br/>
</p>
				<p class="poem">Thus farr to try thee, <i>Adam</i>, I was pleas’d,<br/>
And finde thee knowing not of Beasts alone,<br/>
Which thou hast rightly nam’d, but of thy self,<br/>
Expressing well the spirit within thee free,<br/>
My Image, not imparted to the Brute,<br/>
Whose fellowship therefore unmeet for thee<br/>
Good reason was thou freely shouldst dislike,<br/>
And be so minded still; I, ere thou spak’st,<br/>
Knew it not good for Man to be alone,<br/>
And no such companie as then thou saw’st<br/>
Intended thee, for trial onely brought,<br/>
To see how thou could’st judge of fit and meet:<br/>
What next I bring shall please thee, be assur’d,<br/>
Thy likeness, thy fit help, thy other self,<br/>
Thy wish, exactly to thy hearts desire.<br/>
</p>
				<p class="poem">Hee ended, or I heard no more, for now<br/>
My earthly by his Heav’nly overpowerd,<br/>
Which it had long stood under, streind to the highth<br/>
In that celestial Colloquie sublime,<br/>
As with an object that excels the sense,<br/>
Dazl’d and spent, sunk down, and sought repair<br/>
Of sleep, which instantly fell on me, call’d<br/>
By Nature as in aide, and clos’d mine eyes.<br/>
Mine eyes he clos’d, but op’n left the Cell<br/>
Of Fancie my internal sight, by which<br/>
Abstract as in a transe methought I saw,<br/>
Though sleeping, where I lay, and saw the shape<br/>
Still glorious before whom awake I stood;<br/>
Who stooping op’nd my left side, and took<br/>
From thence a Rib, with cordial spirits warme,<br/>
And Life-blood streaming fresh; wide was the wound,<br/>
But suddenly with flesh fill’d up &amp; heal’d:<br/>
The Rib he formd and fashond with his hands;<br/>
Under his forming hands a Creature grew,<br/>
Manlike, but different sex, so lovly faire,<br/>
That what seemd fair in all the World, seemd now<br/>
Mean, or in her summd up, in her containd<br/>
And in her looks, which from that time infus’d<br/>
Sweetness into my heart, unfelt before,<br/>
And into all things from her Aire inspir’d<br/>
The spirit of love and amorous delight.<br/>
She disappeerd, and left me dark, I wak’d<br/>
To find her, or for ever to deplore<br/>
Her loss, and other pleasures all abjure:<br/>
When out of hope, behold her, not farr off,<br/>
Such as I saw her in my dream, adornd<br/>
With what all Earth or Heaven could bestow<br/>
To make her amiable: On she came,<br/>
Led by her Heav’nly Maker, though unseen,<br/>
And guided by his voice, nor uninformd<br/>
Of nuptial Sanctitie and marriage Rites:<br/>
Grace was in all her steps, Heav’n in her Eye,<br/>
In every gesture dignitie and love.<br/>
I overjoyd could not forbear aloud.<br/>
</p>
				<p class="poem">This turn hath made amends; thou hast fulfill’d<br/>
Thy words, Creator bounteous and benigne,<br/>
Giver of all things faire, but fairest this<br/>
Of all thy gifts, nor enviest.  I now see<br/>
Bone of my Bone, Flesh of my Flesh, my Self<br/>
Before me; Woman is her Name, of Man<br/>
Extracted; for this cause he shall forgoe<br/>
Father and Mother, and to his Wife adhere;<br/>
And they shall be one Flesh, one Heart, one Soule.<br/>
</p>
				<p class="poem">She heard me thus, and though divinely brought,<br/>
Yet Innocence and Virgin Modestie,<br/>
Her vertue and the conscience of her worth,<br/>
That would be woo’d, and not unsought be won,<br/>
Not obvious, not obtrusive, but retir’d,<br/>
The more desirable, or to say all,<br/>
Nature her self, though pure of sinful thought,<br/>
Wrought in her so, that seeing me, she turn’d;<br/>
I follow’d her, she what was Honour knew,<br/>
And with obsequious Majestie approv’d<br/>
My pleaded reason.  To the Nuptial Bowre<br/>
I led her blushing like the Morn: all Heav’n,<br/>
And happie Constellations on that houre<br/>
Shed thir selectest influence; the Earth<br/>
Gave sign of gratulation, and each Hill;<br/>
Joyous the Birds; fresh Gales and gentle Aires<br/>
Whisper’d it to the Woods, and from thir wings<br/>
Flung Rose, flung Odours from the spicie Shrub,<br/>
Disporting, till the amorous Bird of Night<br/>
Sung Spousal, and bid haste the Eevning Starr<br/>
On his Hill top, to light the bridal Lamp.<br/>
Thus I have told thee all my State, and brought<br/>
My Storie to the sum of earthly bliss<br/>
Which I enjoy, and must confess to find<br/>
In all things else delight indeed, but such<br/>
As us’d or not, works in the mind no change,<br/>
Nor vehement desire, these delicacies<br/>
I mean of Taste, Sight, Smell, Herbs, Fruits, &amp; Flours,<br/>
Walks, and the melodie of Birds; but here<br/>
Farr otherwise, transported I behold,<br/>
Transported touch; here passion first I felt,<br/>
Commotion strange, in all enjoyments else<br/>
Superiour and unmov’d, here onely weake<br/>
Against the charm of Beauties powerful glance.<br/>
Or Nature faild in mee, and left some part<br/>
Not proof enough such Object to sustain,<br/>
Or from my side subducting, took perhaps<br/>
More then enough; at least on her bestow’d<br/>
Too much of Ornament, in outward shew<br/>
Elaborate, of inward less exact.<br/>
For well I understand in the prime end<br/>
Of Nature her th’ inferiour, in the mind<br/>
And inward Faculties, which most excell,<br/>
In outward also her resembling less<br/>
His Image who made both, and less expressing<br/>
The character of that Dominion giv’n<br/>
O’re other Creatures; yet when I approach<br/>
Her loveliness, so absolute she seems<br/>
And in her self compleat, so well to know<br/>
Her own, that what she wills to do or say,<br/>
Seems wisest, vertuousest, discreetest, best;<br/>
All higher knowledge in her presence falls<br/>
Degraded, Wisdom in discourse with her<br/>
Looses discount’nanc’t, and like folly shewes;<br/>
Authoritie and Reason on her waite,<br/>
As one intended first, not after made<br/>
Occasionally; and to consummate all,<br/>
Greatness of mind and nobleness thir seat<br/>
Build in her loveliest, and create an awe<br/>
About her, as a guard Angelic plac’t.<br/>
To whom the Angel with contracted brow.<br/>
</p>
				<p class="poem">Accuse not Nature, she hath don her part;<br/>
Do thou but thine, and be not diffident<br/>
Of Wisdom, she deserts thee not, if thou<br/>
Dismiss not her, when most thou needst her nigh,<br/>
By attributing overmuch to things<br/>
Less excellent, as thou thy self perceav’st.<br/>
For what admir’st thou, what transports thee so,<br/>
An outside? fair no doubt, and worthy well<br/>
Thy cherishing, thy honouring, and thy love,<br/>
Not thy subjection: weigh with her thy self;<br/>
Then value: Oft times nothing profits more<br/>
Then self-esteem, grounded on just and right<br/>
Well manag’d; of that skill the more thou know’st,<br/>
The more she will acknowledge thee her Head,<br/>
And to realities yeild all her shows;<br/>
Made so adorn for thy delight the more,<br/>
So awful, that with honour thou maist love<br/>
Thy mate, who sees when thou art seen least wise.<br/>
But if the sense of touch whereby mankind<br/>
Is propagated seem such dear delight<br/>
Beyond all other, think the same voutsaf’t<br/>
To Cattel and each Beast; which would not be<br/>
To them made common &amp; divulg’d, if aught<br/>
Therein enjoy’d were worthy to subdue<br/>
The Soule of Man, or passion in him move.<br/>
What higher in her societie thou findst<br/>
Attractive, human, rational, love still;<br/>
In loving thou dost well, in passion not,<br/>
Wherein true Love consists not; love refines<br/>
The thoughts, and heart enlarges, hath his seat<br/>
In Reason, and is judicious, is the scale<br/>
By which to heav’nly Love thou maist ascend,<br/>
Not sunk in carnal pleasure, for which cause<br/>
Among the Beasts no Mate for thee was found.<br/>
</p>
				<p class="poem">To whom thus half abash’t <i>Adam</i> repli’d.<br/>
Neither her out-side formd so fair, nor aught<br/>
In procreation common to all kindes<br/>
(Though higher of the genial Bed by far,<br/>
And with mysterious reverence I deem)<br/>
So much delights me, as those graceful acts,<br/>
Those thousand decencies that daily flow<br/>
From all her words and actions, mixt with Love<br/>
And sweet compliance, which declare unfeign’d<br/>
Union of Mind, or in us both one Soule;<br/>
Harmonie to behold in wedded pair<br/>
More grateful then harmonious sound to the eare.<br/>
Yet these subject not; I to thee disclose<br/>
What inward thence I feel, not therefore foild,<br/>
Who meet with various objects, from the sense<br/>
Variously representing; yet still free<br/>
Approve the best, and follow what I approve.<br/>
To love thou blam’st me not, for love thou saist<br/>
Leads up to Heav’n, is both the way and guide;<br/>
Bear with me then, if lawful what I ask;<br/>
Love not the heav’nly Spirits, and how thir Love<br/>
Express they, by looks onely, or do they mix<br/>
Irradiance, virtual or immediate touch?<br/>
</p>
				<p class="poem">To whom the Angel with a smile that glow’d<br/>
Celestial rosie red, Loves proper hue,<br/>
Answer’d.  Let it suffice thee that thou know’st<br/>
Us happie, and without Love no happiness.<br/>
Whatever pure thou in the body enjoy’st<br/>
(And pure thou wert created) we enjoy<br/>
In eminence, and obstacle find none<br/>
Of membrane, joynt, or limb, exclusive barrs:<br/>
Easier then Air with Air, if Spirits embrace,<br/>
Total they mix, Union of Pure with Pure<br/>
Desiring; nor restrain’d conveyance need<br/>
As Flesh to mix with Flesh, or Soul with Soul.<br/>
But I can now no more; the parting Sun<br/>
Beyond the Earths green Cape and verdant Isles<br/>
<i>Hesperean</i> sets, my Signal to depart.<br/>
Be strong, live happie, and love, but first of all<br/>
Him whom to love is to obey, and keep<br/>
His great command; take heed least Passion sway<br/>
Thy Judgement to do aught, which else free Will<br/>
Would not admit; thine and of all thy Sons<br/>
The weal or woe in thee is plac’t; beware.<br/>
I in thy persevering shall rejoyce,<br/>
And all the Blest: stand fast; to stand or fall<br/>
Free in thine own Arbitrement it lies.<br/>
Perfet within, no outward aid require;<br/>
And all temptation to transgress repel.<br/>
</p>
				<p class="poem">So saying, he arose; whom <i>Adam</i> thus<br/>
Follow’d with benediction.  Since to part,<br/>
Go heavenly Guest, Ethereal Messenger,<br/>
Sent from whose sovran goodness I adore.<br/>
Gentle to me and affable hath been<br/>
Thy condescension, and shall be honour’d ever<br/>
With grateful Memorie: thou to mankind<br/>
Be good and friendly still, and oft return.<br/>
</p>
				<p class="poem">So parted they, the Angel up to Heav’n<br/>
From the thick shade, and <i>Adam</i> to his Bowre.<br/>
