				<p>
					<span>Descend from Heav’n <i>Urania</i>, by that name</span>
					<br/>
					<span>If rightly thou art call’d, whose Voice divine</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Following, above th’ <i>Olympian</i> Hill I soare,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Above the flight of <i>Pegasean</i> wing.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The meaning, not the Name I call: for thou</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Nor of the Muses nine, nor on the top</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of old <i>Olympus</i> dwell’st, but Heav’nlie borne,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Before the Hills appeerd, or Fountain flow’d,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thou with Eternal wisdom didst converse,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Wisdom thy Sister, and with her didst play</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In presence of th’ Almightie Father, pleas’d</span>
					<br/>
					<span>With thy Celestial Song.  Up led by thee</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Into the Heav’n of Heav’ns I have presum’d,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>An Earthlie Guest, and drawn Empyreal Aire,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thy tempring; with like safetie guided down</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Return me to my Native Element:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Least from this flying Steed unrein’d, (as once</span>
					<br/>
					<span><i>Bellerophon</i>, though from a lower Clime)</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Dismounted, on th’ <i>Aleian</i> Field I fall</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Erroneous, there to wander and forlorne.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Half yet remaines unsung, but narrower bound</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Within the visible Diurnal Spheare;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Standing on Earth, not rapt above the Pole,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>More safe I Sing with mortal voice, unchang’d</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To hoarce or mute, though fall’n on evil dayes,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>On evil dayes though fall’n, and evil tongues;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In darkness, and with dangers compast rouud,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And solitude; yet not alone, while thou</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Visit’st my slumbers Nightly, or when Morn</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Purples the East: still govern thou my Song,</span>
					<br/>
					<span><i>Urania</i>, and fit audience find, though few.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But drive farr off the barbarous dissonance</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of <i>Bacchus</i> and his Revellers, the Race</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of that wilde Rout that tore the <i>Thracian</i> Bard</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In <i>Rhodope</i>, where Woods and Rocks had Eares</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To rapture, till the savage clamor dround</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Both Harp and Voice; nor could the Muse defend</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Her Son.  So fail not thou, who thee implores:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For thou art Heav’nlie, shee an empty dreame.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Say Goddess, what ensu’d when <i>Raphael</i>,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The affable Arch-angel, had forewarn’d</span>
					<br/>
					<span><i>Adam</i> by dire example to beware</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Apostasie, by what befell in Heaven</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To those Apostates, least the like befall</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In Paradise to <i>Adam</i> or his Race,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Charg’d not to touch the interdicted Tree,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>If they transgress, and slight that sole command,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>So easily obeyd amid the choice</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of all tasts else to please thir appetite,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Though wandring.  He with his consorted <i>Eve</i></span>
					<br/>
					<span>The storie heard attentive, and was fill’d</span>
					<br/>
					<span>With admiration, and deep Muse to heare</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of things so high and strange, things to thir thought</span>
					<br/>
					<span>So unimaginable as hate in Heav’n,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And Warr so neer the Peace of God in bliss</span>
					<br/>
					<span>With such confusion: but the evil soon</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Driv’n back redounded as a flood on those</span>
					<br/>
					<span>From whom it sprung, impossible to mix</span>
					<br/>
					<span>With Blessedness.  Whence <i>Adam</i> soon repeal’d</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The doubts that in his heart arose: and now</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Led on, yet sinless, with desire to know</span>
					<br/>
					<span>What neerer might concern him, how this World</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of Heav’n and Earth conspicuous first began,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>When, and whereof created, for what cause,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>What within <i>Eden</i> or without was done</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Before his memorie, as one whose drouth</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Yet scarce allay’d still eyes the current streame,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Whose liquid murmur heard new thirst excites,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Proceeded thus to ask his Heav’nly Guest.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Great things, and full of wonder in our eares,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Farr differing from this World, thou hast reveal’d</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Divine Interpreter, by favour sent</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Down from the Empyrean to forewarne</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Us timely of what might else have bin our loss,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Unknown, which human knowledg could not reach:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For which to the infinitly Good we owe</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Immortal thanks, and his admonishment</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Receave with solemne purpose to observe</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Immutably his sovran will, the end</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of what we are.  But since thou hast voutsaf’t</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Gently for our instruction to impart</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Things above Earthly thought, which yet concernd</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Our knowing, as to highest wisdom seemd,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Deign to descend now lower, and relate</span>
					<br/>
					<span>What may no less perhaps availe us known,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>How first began this Heav’n which we behold</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Distant so high, with moving Fires adornd</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Innumerable, and this which yeelds or fills</span>
					<br/>
					<span>All space, the ambient Aire wide interfus’d</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Imbracing round this florid Earth, what cause</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Mov’d the Creator in his holy Rest</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Through all Eternitie so late to build</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In <i>Chaos</i>, and the work begun, how soon</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Absolv’d, if unforbid thou maist unfould</span>
					<br/>
					<span>What wee, not to explore the secrets aske</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of his Eternal Empire, but the more</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To magnifie his works, the more we know.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And the great Light of Day yet wants to run</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Much of his Race though steep, suspens in Heav’n</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Held by thy voice, thy potent voice he heares,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And longer will delay to heare thee tell</span>
					<br/>
					<span>His Generation, and the rising Birth</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of Nature from the unapparent Deep:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Or if the Starr of Eevning and the Moon</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Haste to thy audience, Night with her will bring</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Silence, and Sleep listning to thee will watch,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Or we can bid his absence, till thy Song</span>
					<br/>
					<span>End, and dismiss thee ere the Morning shine.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Thus <i>Adam</i> his illustrous Guest besought:</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>And thus the Godlike Angel answerd milde.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>This also thy request with caution askt</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Obtaine: though to recount Almightie works</span>
					<br/>
					<span>What words or tongue of Seraph can suffice,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Or heart of man suffice to comprehend?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Yet what thou canst attain, which best may serve</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To glorifie the Maker, and inferr</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thee also happier, shall not be withheld</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thy hearing, such Commission from above</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I have receav’d, to answer thy desire</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of knowledge within bounds; beyond abstain</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To ask, nor let thine own inventions hope</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Things not reveal’d, which th’ invisible King,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Onely Omniscient, hath supprest in Night,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To none communicable in Earth or Heaven:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Anough is left besides to search and know.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But Knowledge is as food, and needs no less</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Her Temperance over Appetite, to know</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In measure what the mind may well contain,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Oppresses else with Surfet, and soon turns</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Wisdom to Folly, as Nourishment to Winde.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Know then, that after <i>Lucifer</i> from Heav’n</span>
					<br/>
					<span>(So call him, brighter once amidst the Host</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of Angels, then that Starr the Starrs among)</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Fell with his flaming Legions through the Deep</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Into his place, and the great Son returnd</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Victorious with his Saints, th’ Omnipotent</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Eternal Father from his Throne beheld</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thir multitude, and to his Son thus spake.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>At least our envious Foe hath fail’d, who thought</span>
					<br/>
					<span>All like himself rebellious, by whose aid</span>
					<br/>
					<span>This inaccessible high strength, the seat</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of Deitie supream, us dispossest,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He trusted to have seis’d, and into fraud</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Drew many, whom thir place knows here no more;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Yet farr the greater part have kept, I see,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thir station, Heav’n yet populous retaines</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Number sufficient to possess her Realmes</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Though wide, and this high Temple to frequent</span>
					<br/>
					<span>With Ministeries due and solemn Rites:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But least his heart exalt him in the harme</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Already done, to have dispeopl’d Heav’n,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>My damage fondly deem’d, I can repaire</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That detriment, if such it be to lose</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Self-lost, and in a moment will create</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Another World, out of one man a Race</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of men innumerable, there to dwell,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Not here, till by degrees of merit rais’d</span>
					<br/>
					<span>They open to themselves at length the way</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Up hither, under long obedience tri’d,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And Earth be chang’d to Heavn, &amp; Heav’n to Earth,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>One Kingdom, Joy and Union without end.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Mean while inhabit laxe, ye Powers of Heav’n,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And thou my Word, begotten Son, by thee</span>
					<br/>
					<span>This I perform, speak thou, and be it don:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>My overshadowing Spirit and might with thee</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I send along, ride forth, and bid the Deep</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Within appointed bounds be Heav’n and Earth,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Boundless the Deep, because I am who fill</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Infinitude, nor vacuous the space.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Though I uncircumscrib’d my self retire,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And put not forth my goodness, which is free</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To act or not, Necessitie and Chance</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Approach not mee, and what I will is Fate.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>So spake th’ Almightie, and to what he spake</span>
					<br/>
					<span>His Word, the Filial Godhead, gave effect.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Immediate are the Acts of God, more swift</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Then time or motion, but to human ears</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Cannot without process of speech be told,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>So told as earthly notion can receave.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Great triumph and rejoycing was in Heav’n</span>
					<br/>
					<span>When such was heard declar’d the Almightie’s will;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Glorie they sung to the most High, good will</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To future men, and in thir dwellings peace:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Glorie to him whose just avenging ire</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Had driven out th’ ungodly from his sight</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And th’ habitations of the just; to him</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Glorie and praise, whose wisdom had ordain’d</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Good out of evil to create, in stead</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of Spirits maligne a better Race to bring</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Into thir vacant room, and thence diffuse</span>
					<br/>
					<span>His good to Worlds and Ages infinite.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>So sang the Hierarchies: Mean while the Son</span>
					<br/>
					<span>On his great Expedition now appeer’d,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Girt with Omnipotence, with Radiance crown’d</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of Majestie Divine, Sapience and Love</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Immense, and all his Father in him shon.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>About his Chariot numberless were pour’d</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Cherub and Seraph, Potentates and Thrones,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And Vertues, winged Spirits, and Chariots wing’d,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>From the Armoury of God, where stand of old</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Myriads between two brazen Mountains lodg’d</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Against a solemn day, harnest at hand,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Celestial Equipage; and now came forth</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Spontaneous, for within them Spirit livd,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Attendant on thir Lord: Heav’n op’nd wide</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Her ever during Gates, Harmonious sound</span>
					<br/>
					<span>On golden Hinges moving, to let forth</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The King of Glorie in his powerful Word</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And Spirit coming to create new Worlds.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>On heav’nly ground they stood, and from the shore</span>
					<br/>
					<span>They view’d the vast immeasurable Abyss</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Outrageous as a Sea, dark, wasteful, wilde,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Up from the bottom turn’d by furious windes</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And surging waves, as Mountains to assault</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Heav’ns highth, and with the Center mix the Pole.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Silence, ye troubl’d waves, and thou Deep, peace,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Said then th’ Omnific Word, your discord end:</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Nor staid, but on the Wings of Cherubim</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Uplifted, in Paternal Glorie rode</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Farr into <i>Chaos</i>, and the World unborn;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For <i>Chaos</i> heard his voice: him all his Traine</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Follow’d in bright procession to behold</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Creation, and the wonders of his might.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Then staid the fervid Wheeles, and in his hand</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He took the golden Compasses, prepar’d</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In Gods Eternal store, to circumscribe</span>
					<br/>
					<span>This Universe, and all created things:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>One foot he center’d, and the other turn’d</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Round through the vast profunditie obscure,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And said, thus farr extend, thus farr thy bounds,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>This be thy just Circumference, O World.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thus God the Heav’n created, thus the Earth,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Matter unform’d and void: Darkness profound</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Cover’d th’ Abyss: but on the watrie calme</span>
					<br/>
					<span>His brooding wings the Spirit of God outspred,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And vital vertue infus’d, and vital warmth</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Throughout the fluid Mass, but downward purg’d</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The black tartareous cold infernal dregs</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Adverse to life: then founded, then conglob’d</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Like things to like, the rest to several place</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Disparted, and between spun out the Air,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And Earth self-ballanc’t on her Center hung.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Let ther be Light, said God, and forthwith Light</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Ethereal, first of things, quintessence pure</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Sprung from the Deep, and from her Native East</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To journie through the airie gloom began,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Sphear’d in a radiant Cloud, for yet the Sun</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Was not; shee in a cloudie Tabernacle</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Sojourn’d the while.  God saw the Light was good;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And light from darkness by the Hemisphere</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Divided: Light the Day, and Darkness Night</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He nam’d.  Thus was the first Day Eev’n and Morn:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Nor past uncelebrated, nor unsung</span>
					<br/>
					<span>By the Celestial Quires, when Orient Light</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Exhaling first from Darkness they beheld;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Birth-day of Heav’n and Earth; with joy and shout</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The hollow Universal Orb they fill’d,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And touch’t thir Golden Harps, &amp; hymning prais’d</span>
					<br/>
					<span>God and his works, Creatour him they sung,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Both when first Eevning was, and when first Morn.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Again, God said, let ther be Firmament</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Amid the Waters, and let it divide</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The Waters from the Waters: and God made</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The Firmament, expanse of liquid, pure,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Transparent, Elemental Air, diffus’d</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In circuit to the uttermost convex</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of this great Round: partition firm and sure,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The Waters underneath from those above</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Dividing: for as Earth, so hee the World</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Built on circumfluous Waters calme, in wide</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Crystallin Ocean, and the loud misrule</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of <i>Chaos</i> farr remov’d, least fierce extreames</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Contiguous might distemper the whole frame:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And Heav’n he nam’d the Firmament: So Eev’n</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And Morning <i>Chorus</i> sung the second Day.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>The Earth was form’d, but in the Womb as yet</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of Waters, Embryon immature involv’d,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Appeer’d not: over all the face of Earth</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Main Ocean flow’d, not idle, but with warme</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Prolific humour soft’ning all her Globe,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Fermented the great Mother to conceave,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Satiate with genial moisture, when God said</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Be gather’d now ye Waters under Heav’n</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Into one place, and let dry Land appeer.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Immediately the Mountains huge appeer</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Emergent, and thir broad bare backs upheave</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Into the Clouds, thir tops ascend the Skie:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>So high as heav’d the tumid Hills, so low</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Down sunk a hollow bottom broad and deep,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Capacious bed of Waters: thither they</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Hasted with glad precipitance, uprowld</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As drops on dust conglobing from the drie;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Part rise in crystal Wall, or ridge direct,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For haste; such flight the great command impress’d</span>
					<br/>
					<span>On the swift flouds: as Armies at the call</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of Trumpet (for of Armies thou hast heard)</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Troop to thir Standard, so the watrie throng,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Wave rowling after Wave, where way they found,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>If steep, with torrent rapture, if through Plaine,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Soft-ebbing; nor withstood them Rock or Hill,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But they, or under ground, or circuit wide</span>
					<br/>
					<span>With Serpent errour wandring, found thir way,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And on the washie Oose deep Channels wore;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Easie, e’re God had bid the ground be drie,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>All but within those banks, where Rivers now</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Stream, and perpetual draw thir humid traine.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The dry Land, Earth, and the great receptacle</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of congregated Waters he call’d Seas:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And saw that it was good, and said, Let th’ Earth</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Put forth the verdant Grass, Herb yeilding Seed,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And Fruit Tree yeilding Fruit after her kind;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Whose Seed is in her self upon the Earth.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He scarce had said, when the bare Earth, till then</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Desert and bare, unsightly, unadorn’d,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Brought forth the tender Grass, whose verdure clad</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Her Universal Face with pleasant green,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Then Herbs of every leaf, that sudden flour’d</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Op’ning thir various colours, and made gay</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Her bosom smelling sweet: and these scarce blown,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Forth flourish’t thick the clustring Vine, forth crept</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The smelling Gourd, up stood the cornie Reed</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Embattell’d in her field: add the humble Shrub,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And Bush with frizl’d hair implicit: last</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Rose as in Dance the stately Trees, and spred</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thir branches hung with copious Fruit; or gemm’d</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thir Blossoms: with high Woods the Hills were crownd,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>With tufts the vallies &amp; each fountain side,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>With borders long the Rivers.  That Earth now</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Seemd like to Heav’n, a seat where Gods might dwell,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Or wander with delight, and love to haunt</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Her sacred shades: though God had yet not rain’d</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Upon the Earth, and man to till the ground</span>
					<br/>
					<span>None was, but from the Earth a dewie Mist</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Went up and waterd all the ground, and each</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Plant of the field, which e’re it was in the Earth</span>
					<br/>
					<span>God made, and every Herb, before it grew</span>
					<br/>
					<span>On the green stemm; God saw that it was good:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>So Eev’n and Morn recorded the Third Day.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Again th’ Almightie spake: Let there be Lights</span>
					<br/>
					<span>High in th’ expanse of Heaven to divide</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The Day from Night; and let them be for Signes,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For Seasons, and for Dayes, and circling Years,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And let them be for Lights as I ordaine</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thir Office in the Firmament of Heav’n</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To give Light on the Earth; and it was so.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And God made two great Lights, great for thir use</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To Man, the greater to have rule by Day,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The less by Night alterne: and made the Starrs,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And set them in the Firmament of Heav’n</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To illuminate the Earth, and rule the Day</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In thir vicissitude, and rule the Night,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And Light from Darkness to divide.  God saw,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Surveying his great Work, that it was good:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For of Celestial Bodies first the Sun</span>
					<br/>
					<span>A mightie Spheare he fram’d, unlightsom first,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Though of Ethereal Mould: then form’d the Moon</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Globose, and everie magnitude of Starrs,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And sowd with Starrs the Heav’n thick as a field:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of Light by farr the greater part he took,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Transplanted from her cloudie Shrine, and plac’d</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In the Suns Orb, made porous to receive</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And drink the liquid Light, firm to retaine</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Her gather’d beams, great Palace now of Light.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Hither as to thir Fountain other Starrs</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Repairing, in thir gold’n Urns draw Light,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And hence the Morning Planet guilds his horns;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>By tincture or reflection they augment</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thir small peculiar, though from human sight</span>
					<br/>
					<span>So farr remote, with diminution seen.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>First in his East the glorious Lamp was seen,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Regent of Day, and all th’ Horizon round</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Invested with bright Rayes, jocond to run</span>
					<br/>
					<span>His Longitude through Heav’ns high rode: the gray</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Dawn, and the <i>Pleiades</i> before him danc’d</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Shedding sweet influence: less bright the Moon,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But opposite in leveld West was set</span>
					<br/>
					<span>His mirror, with full face borrowing her Light</span>
					<br/>
					<span>From him, for other light she needed none</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In that aspect, and still that distance keepes</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Till night, then in the East her turn she shines,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Revolvd on Heav’ns great Axle, and her Reign</span>
					<br/>
					<span>With thousand lesser Lights dividual holds,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>With thousand thousand Starres, that then appeer’d</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Spangling the Hemisphere: then first adornd</span>
					<br/>
					<span>With thir bright Luminaries that Set and Rose,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Glad Eevning &amp; glad Morn crownd the fourth day.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>And God said, let the Waters generate</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Reptil with Spawn abundant, living Soule:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And let Fowle flie above the Earth, with wings</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Displayd on the op’n Firmament of Heav’n.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And God created the great Whales, and each</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Soul living, each that crept, which plenteously</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The waters generated by thir kindes,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And every Bird of wing after his kinde;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And saw that it was good, and bless’d them, saying,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Be fruitful, multiply, and in the Seas</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And Lakes and running Streams the waters fill;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And let the Fowle be multiply’d on the Earth.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Forthwith the Sounds and Seas, each Creek &amp; Bay</span>
					<br/>
					<span>With Frie innumerable swarme, and Shoales</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of Fish that with thir Finns and shining Scales</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Glide under the green Wave, in Sculles that oft</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Bank the mid Sea: part single or with mate</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Graze the Sea weed thir pasture, &amp; through Groves</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of Coral stray, or sporting with quick glance</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Show to the Sun thir wav’d coats dropt with Gold,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Or in thir Pearlie shells at ease, attend</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Moist nutriment, or under Rocks thir food</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In jointed Armour watch: on smooth the Seale,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And bended Dolphins play: part huge of bulk</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Wallowing unweildie, enormous in thir Gate</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Tempest the Ocean: there Leviathan</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Hugest of living Creatures, on the Deep</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Stretcht like a Promontorie sleeps or swimmes,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And seems a moving Land, and at his Gilles</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Draws in, and at his Trunck spouts out a Sea.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Mean while the tepid Caves, and Fens and shoares</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thir Brood as numerous hatch, from the Egg that soon</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Bursting with kindly rupture forth disclos’d</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thir callow young, but featherd soon and fledge</span>
					<br/>
					<span>They summ’d thir Penns, and soaring th’ air sublime</span>
					<br/>
					<span>With clang despis’d the ground, under a cloud</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In prospect; there the Eagle and the Stork</span>
					<br/>
					<span>On Cliffs and Cedar tops thir Eyries build:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Part loosly wing the Region, part more wise</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In common, rang’d in figure wedge thir way,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Intelligent of seasons, and set forth</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thir Aierie Caravan high over Sea’s</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Flying, and over Lands with mutual wing</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Easing thir flight; so stears the prudent Crane</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Her annual Voiage, born on Windes; the Aire</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Floats, as they pass, fann’d with unnumber’d plumes:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>From Branch to Branch the smaller Birds with song</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Solac’d the Woods, and spred thir painted wings</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Till Ev’n, nor then the solemn Nightingal</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Ceas’d warbling, but all night tun’d her soft layes:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Others on Silver Lakes and Rivers Bath’d</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thir downie Brest; the Swan with Arched neck</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Between her white wings mantling proudly, Rowes</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Her state with Oarie feet: yet oft they quit</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The Dank, and rising on stiff Pennons, towre</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The mid Aereal Skie: Others on ground</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Walk’d firm; the crested Cock whose clarion sounds</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The silent hours, and th’ other whose gay Traine</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Adorns him, colour’d with the Florid hue</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of Rainbows and Starrie Eyes.  The Waters thus</span>
					<br/>
					<span>With Fish replenisht, and the Aire with Fowle,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Ev’ning and Morn solemniz’d the Fift day.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>The Sixt, and of Creation last arose</span>
					<br/>
					<span>With Eevning Harps and Mattin, when God said,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Let th’ Earth bring forth Fowle living in her kinde,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Cattel and Creeping things, and Beast of the Earth,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Each in their kinde.  The Earth obey’d, and strait</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Op’ning her fertil Woomb teem’d at a Birth</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Innumerous living Creatures, perfet formes,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Limb’d and full grown: out of the ground up-rose</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As from his Laire the wilde Beast where he wonns</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In Forrest wilde, in Thicket, Brake, or Den;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Among the Trees in Pairs they rose, they walk’d:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The Cattel in the Fields and Meddowes green:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Those rare and solitarie, these in flocks</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Pasturing at once, and in broad Herds upsprung:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The grassie Clods now Calv’d, now half appeer’d</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The Tawnie Lion, pawing to get free</span>
					<br/>
					<span>His hinder parts, then springs as broke from Bonds,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And Rampant shakes his Brinded main; the Ounce,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The Libbard, and the Tyger, as the Moale</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Rising, the crumbl’d Earth above them threw</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In Hillocks; the swift Stag from under ground</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Bore up his branching head: scarse from his mould</span>
					<br/>
					<span><i>Behemoth</i> biggest born of Earth upheav’d</span>
					<br/>
					<span>His vastness: Fleec’t the Flocks and bleating rose,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As Plants: ambiguous between Sea and Land</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The River Horse and scalie Crocodile.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>At once came forth whatever creeps the ground,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Insect or Worme; those wav’d thir limber fans</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For wings, and smallest Lineaments exact</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In all the Liveries dect of Summers pride</span>
					<br/>
					<span>With spots of Gold and Purple, azure and green:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>These as a line thir long dimension drew,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Streaking the ground with sinuous trace; not all</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Minims of Nature; some of Serpent kinde</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Wondrous in length and corpulence involv’d</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thir Snakie foulds, and added wings.  First crept</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The Parsimonious Emmet, provident</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of future, in small room large heart enclos’d,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Pattern of just equalitie perhaps</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Hereafter, join’d in her popular Tribes</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of Commonaltie: swarming next appeer’d</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The Femal Bee that feeds her Husband Drone</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Deliciously, and builds her waxen Cells</span>
					<br/>
					<span>With Honey stor’d: the rest are numberless,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And thou thir Natures know’st, and gav’st them Names,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Needlest to thee repeaed; nor unknown</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The Serpent suttl’st Beast of all the field,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of huge extent somtimes, with brazen Eyes</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And hairie Main terrific, though to thee</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Not noxious, but obedient at thy call.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Now Heav’n in all her Glorie shon, and rowld</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Her motions, as the great first-Movers hand</span>
					<br/>
					<span>First wheeld thir course; Earth in her rich attire</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Consummate lovly smil’d; Aire, Water, Earth,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>By Fowl, Fish, Beast, was flown, was swum, was walkt</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Frequent; and of the Sixt day yet remain’d;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>There wanted yet the Master work, the end</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of all yet don; a Creature who not prone</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And Brute as other Creatures, but endu’d</span>
					<br/>
					<span>With Sanctitie of Reason, might erect</span>
					<br/>
					<span>His Stature, and upright with Front serene</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Govern the rest, self-knowing, and from thence</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Magnanimous to correspond with Heav’n,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But grateful to acknowledge whence his good</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Descends, thither with heart and voice and eyes</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Directed in Devotion, to adore</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And worship God Supream, who made him chief</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of all his works: therefore the Omnipotent</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Eternal Father (For where is not hee</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Present) thus to his Son audibly spake.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Let us make now Man in our image, Man</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In our similitude, and let them rule</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Over the Fish and Fowle of Sea and Aire,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Beast of the Field, and over all the Earth,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And every creeping thing that creeps the ground.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>This said, he formd thee, <i>Adam</i>, thee O Man</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Dust of the ground, and in thy nostrils breath’d</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The breath of Life; in his own Image hee</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Created thee, in the Image of God</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Express, and thou becam’st a living Soul.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Male he created thee, but thy consort</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Femal for Race; then bless’d Mankinde, and said,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Be fruitful, multiplie, and fill the Earth,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Subdue it, and throughout Dominion hold</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Over Fish of the Sea, and Fowle of the Aire,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And every living thing that moves on the Earth.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Wherever thus created, for no place</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Is yet distinct by name, thence, as thou know’st</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He brought thee into this delicious Grove,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>This Garden, planted with the Trees of God,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Delectable both to behold and taste;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And freely all thir pleasant fruit for food</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Gave thee, all sorts are here that all th’ Earth yeelds,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Varietie without end; but of the Tree</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Which tasted works knowledge of Good and Evil,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thou mai’st not; in the day thou eat’st, thou di’st;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Death is the penaltie impos’d, beware,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And govern well thy appetite, least sin</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Surprise thee, and her black attendant Death.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Here finish’d hee, and all that he had made</span>
					<br/>
					<span>View’d, and behold all was entirely good;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>So Ev’n and Morn accomplish’d the Sixt day:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Yet not till the Creator from his work</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Desisting, though unwearied, up returnd</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Up to the Heav’n of Heav’ns his high abode,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thence to behold this new created World</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Th’ addition of his Empire, how it shew’d</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In prospect from his Throne, how good, how faire,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Answering his great Idea.  Up he rode</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Followd with acclamation and the sound</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Symphonious of ten thousand Harpes that tun’d</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Angelic harmonies: the Earth, the Aire</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Resounded, (thou remember’st, for thou heardst)</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The Heav’ns and all the Constellations rung,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The Planets in thir stations list’ning stood,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>While the bright Pomp ascended jubilant.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Open, ye everlasting Gates, they sung,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Open, ye Heav’ns, your living dores; let in</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The great Creator from his work returnd</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Magnificent, his Six days work, a World;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Open, and henceforth oft; for God will deigne</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To visit oft the dwellings of just Men</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Delighted, and with frequent intercourse</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thither will send his winged Messengers</span>
					<br/>
					<span>On errands of supernal Grace.  So sung</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The glorious Train ascending: He through Heav’n,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That open’d wide her blazing Portals, led</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To Gods Eternal house direct the way,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>A broad and ample rode, whose dust is Gold</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And pavement Starrs, as Starrs to thee appeer,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Seen in the Galaxie, that Milkie way</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Which nightly as a circling Zone thou seest</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Pouderd with Starrs.  And now on Earth the Seaventh</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Eev’ning arose in <i>Eden</i>, for the Sun</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Was set, and twilight from the East came on,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Forerunning Night; when at the holy mount</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of Heav’ns high-seated top, th’ Impereal Throne</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of Godhead, fixt for ever firm and sure,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The Filial Power arriv’d, and sate him down</span>
					<br/>
					<span>With his great Father (for he also went</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Invisible, yet staid (such priviledge</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Hath Omnipresence) and the work ordain’d,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Author and end of all things, and from work</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Now resting, bless’d and hallowd the Seav’nth day,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As resting on that day from all his work,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But not in silence holy kept; the Harp</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Had work and rested not, the solemn Pipe,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And Dulcimer, all Organs of sweet stop,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>All sounds on Fret by String or Golden Wire</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Temper’d soft Tunings, intermixt with Voice</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Choral or Unison: of incense Clouds</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Fuming from Golden Censers hid the Mount.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Creation and the Six dayes acts they sung,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Great are thy works, <i>Jehovah</i>, infinite</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thy power; what thought can measure thee or tongue</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Relate thee; greater now in thy return</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Then from the Giant Angels; thee that day</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thy Thunders magnifi’d; but to create</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Is greater then created to destroy.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Who can impair thee, mighty King, or bound</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thy Empire? easily the proud attempt</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of Spirits apostat and thir Counsels vaine</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thou hast repeld, while impiously they thought</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thee to diminish, and from thee withdraw</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The number of thy worshippers.  Who seekes</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To lessen thee, against his purpose serves</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To manifest the more thy might: his evil</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thou usest, and from thence creat’st more good.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Witness this new-made World, another Heav’n</span>
					<br/>
					<span>From Heaven Gate not farr, founded in view</span>
					<br/>
					<span>On the cleer <i>Hyaline</i>, the Glassie Sea;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of amplitude almost immense, with Starr’s</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Numerous, and every Starr perhaps a World</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of destind habitation; but thou know’st</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thir seasons: among these the seat of men,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Earth with her nether Ocean circumfus’d,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thir pleasant dwelling place.  Thrice happie men,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And sons of men, whom God hath thus advanc’t,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Created in his Image, there to dwell</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And worship him, and in reward to rule</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Over his Works, on Earth, in Sea, or Air,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And multiply a Race of Worshippers</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Holy and just: thrice happie if they know</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thir happiness, and persevere upright.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>So sung they, and the Empyrean rung,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>With <i>Halleluiahs</i>: Thus was Sabbath kept.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And thy request think now fulfill’d, that ask’d</span>
					<br/>
					<span>How first this World and face of things began,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And what before thy memorie was don</span>
					<br/>
					<span>From the beginning, that posteritie</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Informd by thee might know; if else thou seekst</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Aught, not surpassing human measure, say.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>To whom thus <i>Adam</i> gratefully repli’d.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>What thanks sufficient, or what recompence</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Equal have I to render thee, Divine</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Hystorian, who thus largely hast allayd</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The thirst I had of knowledge, and voutsaf’t</span>
					<br/>
					<span>This friendly condescention to relate</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Things else by me unsearchable, now heard</span>
					<br/>
					<span>VVith wonder, but delight, and, as is due,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>With glorie attributed to the high</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Creator; some thing yet of doubt remaines,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>VVhich onely thy solution can resolve.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>VVhen I behold this goodly Frame, this VVorld</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of Heav’n and Earth consisting, and compute,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thir magnitudes, this Earth a spot, a graine,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>An Atom, with the Firmament compar’d</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And all her numberd Starrs, that seem to rowle</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Spaces incomprehensible (for such</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thir distance argues and thir swift return</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Diurnal) meerly to officiate light</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Round this opacous Earth, this punctual spot,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>One day and night; in all thir vast survey</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Useless besides, reasoning I oft admire,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>How Nature wise and frugal could commit</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Such disproportions, with superfluous hand</span>
					<br/>
					<span>So many nobler Bodies to create,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Greater so manifold to this one use,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For aught appeers, and on thir Orbs impose</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Such restless revolution day by day</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Repeated, while the sedentarie Earth,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That better might with farr less compass move,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Serv’d by more noble then her self, attaines</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Her end without least motion, and receaves,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As Tribute such a sumless journey brought</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of incorporeal speed, her warmth and light;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Speed, to describe whose swiftness Number failes.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>So spake our Sire, and by his count’nance seemd</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Entring on studious thoughts abstruse, which <i>Eve</i></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Perceaving where she sat retir’d in sight,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>With lowliness Majestic from her seat,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And Grace that won who saw to wish her stay,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Rose, and went forth among her Fruits and Flours,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To visit how they prosper’d, bud and bloom,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Her Nurserie; they at her coming sprung</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And toucht by her fair tendance gladlier grew.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Yet went she not, as not with such discourse</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Delighted, or not capable her eare</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of what was high: such pleasure she reserv’d,</span>
					<br/>
					<span><i>Adam</i> relating, she sole Auditress;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Her Husband the Relater she preferr’d</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Before the Angel, and of him to ask</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Chose rather; hee, she knew would intermix</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Grateful digressions, and solve high dispute</span>
					<br/>
					<span>With conjugal Caresses, from his Lip</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Not Words alone pleas’d her.  O when meet now</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Such pairs, in Love and mutual Honour joyn’d?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>With Goddess-like demeanour forth she went;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Not unattended, for on her as Queen</span>
					<br/>
					<span>A pomp of winning Graces waited still,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And from about her shot Darts of desire</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Into all Eyes to wish her still in sight.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And <i>Raphael</i> now to <i>Adam</i>’s doubt propos’d</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Benevolent and facil thus repli’d.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>To ask or search I blame thee not, for Heav’n</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Is as the Book of God before thee set,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Wherein to read his wondrous Works, and learne</span>
					<br/>
					<span>His Seasons, Hours, or Days, or Months, or Yeares:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>This to attain, whether Heav’n move or Earth,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Imports not, if thou reck’n right, the rest</span>
					<br/>
					<span>From Man or Angel the great Architect</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Did wisely to conceal, and not divulge</span>
					<br/>
					<span>His secrets to be scann’d by them who ought</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Rather admire; or if they list to try</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Conjecture, he his Fabric of the Heav’ns</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Hath left to thir disputes, perhaps to move</span>
					<br/>
					<span>His laughter at thir quaint Opinions wide</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Hereafter, when they come to model Heav’n</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And calculate the Starrs, how they will weild</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The mightie frame, how build, unbuild, contrive</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To save appeerances, how gird the Sphear</span>
					<br/>
					<span>With Centric and Eccentric scribl’d o’re,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Cycle and Epicycle, Orb in Orb:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Alreadie by thy reasoning this I guess,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Who art to lead thy ofspring, and supposest</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That Bodies bright and greater should not serve</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The less not bright, nor Heav’n such journies run,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Earth sitting still, when she alone receaves</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The benefit: consider first, that Great</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Or Bright inferrs not Excellence: the Earth</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Though, in comparison of Heav’n, so small,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Nor glistering, may of solid good containe</span>
					<br/>
					<span>More plenty then the Sun that barren shines,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Whose vertue on it self workes no effect,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But in the fruitful Earth; there first receavd</span>
					<br/>
					<span>His beams, unactive else, thir vigor find.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Yet not to Earth are those bright Luminaries</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Officious, but to thee Earths habitant.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And for the Heav’ns wide Circuit, let it speak</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The Makers high magnificence, who built</span>
					<br/>
					<span>So spacious, and his Line stretcht out so farr;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That Man may know he dwells not in his own;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>An Edifice too large for him to fill,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Lodg’d in a small partition, and the rest</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Ordain’d for uses to his Lord best known.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The swiftness of those Circles attribute,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Though numberless, to his Omnipotence,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That to corporeal substances could adde</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Speed almost Spiritual; mee thou thinkst not slow,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Who since the Morning hour set out from Heav’n</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Where God resides, and ere mid-day arriv’d</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In <i>Eden</i>, distance inexpressible</span>
					<br/>
					<span>By Numbers that have name.  But this I urge,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Admitting Motion in the Heav’ns, to shew</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Invalid that which thee to doubt it mov’d;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Not that I so affirm, though so it seem</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To thee who hast thy dwelling here on Earth.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>God to remove his wayes from human sense,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Plac’d Heav’n from Earth so farr, that earthly sight,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>If it presume, might erre in things too high,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And no advantage gaine.  What if the Sun</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Be Center to the World, and other Starrs</span>
					<br/>
					<span>By his attractive vertue and thir own</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Incited, dance about him various rounds?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thir wandring course now high, now low, then hid,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Progressive, retrograde, or standing still,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In six thou seest, and what if sev’nth to these</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The Planet Earth, so stedfast though she seem,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Insensibly three different Motions move?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Which else to several Sphears thou must ascribe,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Mov’d contrarie with thwart obliquities,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Or save the Sun his labour, and that swift</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Nocturnal and Diurnal rhomb suppos’d,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Invisible else above all Starrs, the Wheele</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of Day and Night; which needs not thy beleefe,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>If Earth industrious of her self fetch Day</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Travelling East, and with her part averse</span>
					<br/>
					<span>From the Suns beam meet Night, her other part</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Still luminous by his ray.  What if that light</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Sent from her through the wide transpicuous aire,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To the terrestrial Moon be as a Starr</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Enlightning her by Day, as she by Night</span>
					<br/>
					<span>This Earth? reciprocal, if Land be there,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Feilds and Inhabitants: Her spots thou seest</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As Clouds, and Clouds may rain, and Rain produce</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Fruits in her soft’nd Soile, for some to eate</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Allotted there; and other Suns perhaps</span>
					<br/>
					<span>With thir attendant Moons thou wilt descrie</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Communicating Male and Femal Light,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Which two great Sexes animate the World,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Stor’d in each Orb perhaps with some that live.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For such vast room in Nature unpossest</span>
					<br/>
					<span>By living Soule, desert and desolate,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Onely to shine, yet scarce to contribute</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Each Orb a glimps of Light, conveyd so farr</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Down to this habitable, which returnes</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Light back to them, is obvious to dispute.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But whether thus these things, or whether not,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Whether the Sun predominant in Heav’n</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Rise on the Earth, or Earth rise on the Sun,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Hee from the East his flaming rode begin,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Or Shee from West her silent course advance</span>
					<br/>
					<span>With inoffensive pace that spinning sleeps</span>
					<br/>
					<span>On her soft Axle, while she paces Eev’n,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And bears thee soft with the smooth Air along,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Sollicit not thy thoughts with matters hid,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Leave them to God above, him serve and feare;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of other Creatures, as him pleases best,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Wherever plac’t, let him dispose: joy thou</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In what he gives to thee, this Paradise</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And thy faire <i>Eve</i>; Heav’n is for thee too high</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To know what passes there; be lowlie wise:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Think onely what concernes thee and thy being;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Dream not of other Worlds, what Creatures there</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Live, in what state, condition or degree,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Contented that thus farr hath been reveal’d</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Not of Earth onely but of highest Heav’n.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>To whom thus <i>Adam</i> cleerd of doubt, repli’d.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>How fully hast thou satisfi’d mee, pure</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Intelligence of Heav’n, Angel serene,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And freed from intricacies, taught to live,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The easiest way, nor with perplexing thoughts</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To interrupt the sweet of Life, from which</span>
					<br/>
					<span>God hath bid dwell farr off all anxious cares,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And not molest us, unless we our selves</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Seek them with wandring thoughts, and notions vaine.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But apt the Mind or Fancie is to roave</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Uncheckt, and of her roaving is no end;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Till warn’d, or by experience taught, she learne,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That not to know at large of things remote</span>
					<br/>
					<span>From use, obscure and suttle, but to know</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That which before us lies in daily life,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Is the prime Wisdom, what is more, is fume,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Or emptiness, or fond impertinence,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And renders us in things that most concerne</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Unpractis’d, unprepar’d, and still to seek.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Therefore from this high pitch let us descend</span>
					<br/>
					<span>A lower flight, and speak of things at hand</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Useful, whence haply mention may arise</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of somthing not unseasonable to ask</span>
					<br/>
					<span>By sufferance, and thy wonted favour deign’d.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thee I have heard relating what was don</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Ere my remembrance: now hear mee relate</span>
					<br/>
					<span>My Storie, which perhaps thou hast not heard;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And Day is yet not spent; till then thou seest</span>
					<br/>
					<span>How suttly to detaine thee I devise,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Inviting thee to hear while I relate,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Fond, were it not in hope of thy reply:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For while I sit with thee, I seem in Heav’n,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And sweeter thy discourse is to my eare</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Then Fruits of Palm-tree pleasantest to thirst</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And hunger both, from labour, at the houre</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of sweet repast; they satiate, and soon fill,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Though pleasant, but thy words with Grace Divine</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Imbu’d, bring to thir sweetness no satietie.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>To whom thus <i>Raphael</i> answer’d heav’nly meek.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Nor are thy lips ungraceful, Sire of men,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Nor tongue ineloquent; for God on thee</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Abundantly his gifts hath also pour’d,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Inward and outward both, his image faire:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Speaking or mute all comliness and grace</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Attends thee, and each word, each motion formes.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Nor less think wee in Heav’n of thee on Earth</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Then of our fellow servant, and inquire</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Gladly into the wayes of God with Man:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For God we see hath honour’d thee, and set</span>
					<br/>
					<span>On Man his equal Love: say therefore on;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For I that Day was absent, as befell,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Bound on a voyage uncouth and obscure,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Farr on excursion toward the Gates of Hell;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Squar’d in full Legion (such command we had)</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To see that none thence issu’d forth a spie,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Or enemie, while God was in his work,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Least hee incenst at such eruption bold,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Destruction with Creation might have mixt.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Not that they durst without his leave attempt,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But us he sends upon his high behests</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For state, as Sovran King, and to enure</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Our prompt obedience.  Fast we found, fast shut</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The dismal Gates, and barricado’d strong;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But long ere our approaching heard within</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Noise, other then the sound of Dance or Song,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Torment, and lowd lament, and furious rage.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Glad we return’d up to the coasts of Light</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Ere Sabbath Eev’ning: so we had in charge.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But thy relation now; for I attend,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Pleas’d with thy words no less then thou with mine.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>So spake the Godlike Power, and thus our Sire.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For Man to tell how human Life began</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Is hard; for who himself beginning knew?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Desire with thee still longer to converse</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Induc’d me.  As new wak’t from soundest sleep</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Soft on the flourie herb I found me laid</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In Balmie Sweat, which with his Beames the Sun</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Soon dri’d, and on the reaking moisture fed.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Strait toward Heav’n my wondring Eyes I turnd,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And gaz’d a while the ample Skie, till rais’d</span>
					<br/>
					<span>By quick instinctive motion up I sprung,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As thitherward endevoring, and upright</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Stood on my feet; about me round I saw</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Hill, Dale, and shadie Woods, and sunnie Plaines,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And liquid Lapse of murmuring Streams; by these,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Creatures that livd, and movd, and walk’d, or flew,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Birds on the branches warbling; all things smil’d,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>With fragrance and with joy my heart oreflow’d.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>My self I then perus’d, and Limb by Limb</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Survey’d, and sometimes went, and sometimes ran</span>
					<br/>
					<span>With supple joints, as lively vigour led:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But who I was, or where, or from what cause,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Knew not; to speak I tri’d, and forthwith spake,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>My Tongue obey’d and readily could name</span>
					<br/>
					<span>What e’re I saw.  Thou Sun, said I, faire Light,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And thou enlight’nd Earth, so fresh and gay,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Ye Hills and Dales, ye Rivers, Woods, and Plaines,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And ye that live and move, fair Creatures, tell,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Tell, if ye saw, how came I thus, how here?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Not of my self; by some great Maker then,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In goodness and in power praeeminent;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Tell me, how may I know him, how adore,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>From whom I have that thus I move and live,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And feel that I am happier then I know.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>While thus I call’d, and stray’d I knew not whither,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>From where I first drew Aire, and first beheld</span>
					<br/>
					<span>This happie Light, when answer none return’d,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>On a green shadie Bank profuse of Flours</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Pensive I sate me down; there gentle sleep</span>
					<br/>
					<span>First found me, and with soft oppression seis’d</span>
					<br/>
					<span>My droused sense, untroubl’d, though I thought</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I then was passing to my former state</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Insensible, and forthwith to dissolve:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>When suddenly stood at my Head a dream,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Whose inward apparition gently mov’d</span>
					<br/>
					<span>My Fancy to believe I yet had being,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And livd: One came, methought, of shape Divine,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And said, thy Mansion wants thee, <i>Adam</i>, rise,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>First Man, of Men innumerable ordain’d</span>
					<br/>
					<span>First Father, call’d by thee I come thy Guide</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To the Garden of bliss, thy seat prepar’d.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>So saying, by the hand he took me rais’d,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And over Fields and Waters, as in Aire</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Smooth sliding without step, last led me up</span>
					<br/>
					<span>A woodie Mountain; whose high top was plaine,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>A Circuit wide, enclos’d, with goodliest Trees</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Planted, with Walks, and Bowers, that what I saw</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of Earth before scarse pleasant seemd.  Each Tree</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Load’n with fairest Fruit, that hung to the Eye</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Tempting, stirr’d in me sudden appetite</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To pluck and eate; whereat I wak’d, and found</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Before mine Eyes all real, as the dream</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Had lively shadowd: Here had new begun</span>
					<br/>
					<span>My wandring, had not hee who was my Guide</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Up hither, from among the Trees appeer’d,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Presence Divine.  Rejoycing, but with aw</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In adoration at his feet I fell</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Submiss: he rear’d me, &amp; Whom thou soughtst I am,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Said mildely, Author of all this thou seest</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Above, or round about thee or beneath.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>This Paradise I give thee, count it thine</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To Till and keep, and of the Fruit to eate:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of every Tree that in the Garden growes</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Eate freely with glad heart; fear here no dearth:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But of the Tree whose operation brings</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Knowledg of good and ill, which I have set</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The Pledge of thy Obedience and thy Faith,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Amid the Garden by the Tree of Life,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Remember what I warne thee, shun to taste,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And shun the bitter consequence: for know,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The day thou eat’st thereof, my sole command</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Transgrest, inevitably thou shalt dye;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>From that day mortal, and this happie State</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Shalt loose, expell’d from hence into a World</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of woe and sorrow.  Sternly he pronounc’d</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The rigid interdiction, which resounds</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Yet dreadful in mine eare, though in my choice</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Not to incur; but soon his cleer aspect</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Return’d and gratious purpose thus renew’d.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Not onely these fair bounds, but all the Earth</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To thee and to thy Race I give; as Lords</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Possess it, and all things that therein live,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Or live in Sea, or Aire, Beast, Fish, and Fowle.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In signe whereof each Bird and Beast behold</span>
					<br/>
					<span>After thir kindes; I bring them to receave</span>
					<br/>
					<span>From thee thir Names, and pay thee fealtie</span>
					<br/>
					<span>With low subjection; understand the same</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of Fish within thir watry residence,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Not hither summond, since they cannot change</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thir Element to draw the thinner Aire.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As thus he spake, each Bird and Beast behold</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Approaching two and two, These cowring low</span>
					<br/>
					<span>With blandishment, each Bird stoop’d on his wing.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I nam’d them, as they pass’d, and understood</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thir Nature, with such knowledg God endu’d</span>
					<br/>
					<span>My sudden apprehension: but in these</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I found not what me thought I wanted still;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And to the Heav’nly vision thus presum’d.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>O by what Name, for thou above all these,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Above mankinde, or aught then mankinde higher,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Surpassest farr my naming, how may I</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Adore thee, Author of this Universe,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And all this good to man, for whose well being</span>
					<br/>
					<span>So amply, and with hands so liberal</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thou hast provided all things: but with mee</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I see not who partakes.  In solitude</span>
					<br/>
					<span>What happiness, who can enjoy alone,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Or all enjoying, what contentment find?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thus I presumptuous; and the vision bright,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As with a smile more bright’nd, thus repli’d.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>What call’st thou solitude, is not the Earth</span>
					<br/>
					<span>With various living creatures, and the Aire</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Replenisht, and all these at thy command</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To come and play before thee, know’st thou not</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thir language and thir wayes, they also know,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And reason not contemptibly; with these</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Find pastime, and beare rule; thy Realm is large.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>So spake the Universal Lord, and seem’d</span>
					<br/>
					<span>So ordering.  I with leave of speech implor’d,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And humble deprecation thus repli’d.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Let not my words offend thee, Heav’nly Power,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>My Maker, be propitious while I speak.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Hast thou not made me here thy substitute,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And these inferiour farr beneath me set?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Among unequals what societie</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Can sort, what harmonie or true delight?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Which must be mutual, in proportion due</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Giv’n and receiv’d; but in disparitie</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The one intense, the other still remiss</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Cannot well suite with either, but soon prove</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Tedious alike: Of fellowship I speak</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Such as I seek, fit to participate</span>
					<br/>
					<span>All rational delight, wherein the brute</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Cannot be human consort; they rejoyce</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Each with thir kinde, Lion with Lioness;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>So fitly them in pairs thou hast combin’d;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Much less can Bird with Beast, or Fish with Fowle</span>
					<br/>
					<span>So well converse, nor with the Ox the Ape;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Wors then can Man with Beast, and least of all.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Whereto th’ Almighty answer’d, not displeas’d.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>A nice and suttle happiness I see</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thou to thy self proposest, in the choice</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of thy Associates, <i>Adam</i>, and wilt taste</span>
					<br/>
					<span>No pleasure, though in pleasure, solitarie.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>What thinkst thou then of mee, and this my State,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Seem I to thee sufficiently possest</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of happiness, or not? who am alone</span>
					<br/>
					<span>From all Eternitie, for none I know</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Second to mee or like, equal much less.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>How have I then with whom to hold converse</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Save with the Creatures which I made, and those</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To me inferiour, infinite descents</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Beneath what other Creatures are to thee?</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>He ceas’d, I lowly answer’d.  To attaine</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The highth and depth of thy Eternal wayes</span>
					<br/>
					<span>All human thoughts come short, Supream of things;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thou in thy self art perfet, and in thee</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Is no deficience found; not so is Man,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But in degree, the cause of his desire</span>
					<br/>
					<span>By conversation with his like to help,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Or solace his defects.  No need that thou</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Shouldst propagat, already infinite;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And through all numbers absolute, though One;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But Man by number is to manifest</span>
					<br/>
					<span>His single imperfection, and beget</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Like of his like, his Image multipli’d,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In unitie defective, which requires</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Collateral love, and deerest amitie.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thou in thy secresie although alone,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Best with thy self accompanied, seek’st not</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Social communication, yet so pleas’d,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Canst raise thy Creature to what highth thou wilt</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of Union or Communion, deifi’d;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I by conversing cannot these erect</span>
					<br/>
					<span>From prone, nor in thir wayes complacence find.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thus I embold’nd spake, and freedom us’d</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Permissive, and acceptance found, which gain’d</span>
					<br/>
					<span>This answer from the gratious voice Divine.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Thus farr to try thee, <i>Adam</i>, I was pleas’d,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And finde thee knowing not of Beasts alone,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Which thou hast rightly nam’d, but of thy self,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Expressing well the spirit within thee free,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>My Image, not imparted to the Brute,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Whose fellowship therefore unmeet for thee</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Good reason was thou freely shouldst dislike,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And be so minded still; I, ere thou spak’st,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Knew it not good for Man to be alone,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And no such companie as then thou saw’st</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Intended thee, for trial onely brought,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To see how thou could’st judge of fit and meet:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>What next I bring shall please thee, be assur’d,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thy likeness, thy fit help, thy other self,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thy wish, exactly to thy hearts desire.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Hee ended, or I heard no more, for now</span>
					<br/>
					<span>My earthly by his Heav’nly overpowerd,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Which it had long stood under, streind to the highth</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In that celestial Colloquie sublime,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As with an object that excels the sense,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Dazl’d and spent, sunk down, and sought repair</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of sleep, which instantly fell on me, call’d</span>
					<br/>
					<span>By Nature as in aide, and clos’d mine eyes.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Mine eyes he clos’d, but op’n left the Cell</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of Fancie my internal sight, by which</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Abstract as in a transe methought I saw,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Though sleeping, where I lay, and saw the shape</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Still glorious before whom awake I stood;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Who stooping op’nd my left side, and took</span>
					<br/>
					<span>From thence a Rib, with cordial spirits warme,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And Life-blood streaming fresh; wide was the wound,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But suddenly with flesh fill’d up &amp; heal’d:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The Rib he formd and fashond with his hands;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Under his forming hands a Creature grew,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Manlike, but different sex, so lovly faire,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That what seemd fair in all the World, seemd now</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Mean, or in her summd up, in her containd</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And in her looks, which from that time infus’d</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Sweetness into my heart, unfelt before,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And into all things from her Aire inspir’d</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The spirit of love and amorous delight.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>She disappeerd, and left me dark, I wak’d</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To find her, or for ever to deplore</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Her loss, and other pleasures all abjure:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>When out of hope, behold her, not farr off,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Such as I saw her in my dream, adornd</span>
					<br/>
					<span>With what all Earth or Heaven could bestow</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To make her amiable: On she came,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Led by her Heav’nly Maker, though unseen,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And guided by his voice, nor uninformd</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of nuptial Sanctitie and marriage Rites:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Grace was in all her steps, Heav’n in her Eye,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In every gesture dignitie and love.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I overjoyd could not forbear aloud.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>This turn hath made amends; thou hast fulfill’d</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thy words, Creator bounteous and benigne,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Giver of all things faire, but fairest this</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of all thy gifts, nor enviest.  I now see</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Bone of my Bone, Flesh of my Flesh, my Self</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Before me; Woman is her Name, of Man</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Extracted; for this cause he shall forgoe</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Father and Mother, and to his Wife adhere;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And they shall be one Flesh, one Heart, one Soule.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>She heard me thus, and though divinely brought,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Yet Innocence and Virgin Modestie,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Her vertue and the conscience of her worth,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That would be woo’d, and not unsought be won,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Not obvious, not obtrusive, but retir’d,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The more desirable, or to say all,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Nature her self, though pure of sinful thought,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Wrought in her so, that seeing me, she turn’d;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I follow’d her, she what was Honour knew,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And with obsequious Majestie approv’d</span>
					<br/>
					<span>My pleaded reason.  To the Nuptial Bowre</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I led her blushing like the Morn: all Heav’n,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And happie Constellations on that houre</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Shed thir selectest influence; the Earth</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Gave sign of gratulation, and each Hill;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Joyous the Birds; fresh Gales and gentle Aires</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Whisper’d it to the Woods, and from thir wings</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Flung Rose, flung Odours from the spicie Shrub,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Disporting, till the amorous Bird of Night</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Sung Spousal, and bid haste the Eevning Starr</span>
					<br/>
					<span>On his Hill top, to light the bridal Lamp.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thus I have told thee all my State, and brought</span>
					<br/>
					<span>My Storie to the sum of earthly bliss</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Which I enjoy, and must confess to find</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In all things else delight indeed, but such</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As us’d or not, works in the mind no change,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Nor vehement desire, these delicacies</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I mean of Taste, Sight, Smell, Herbs, Fruits, &amp; Flours,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Walks, and the melodie of Birds; but here</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Farr otherwise, transported I behold,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Transported touch; here passion first I felt,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Commotion strange, in all enjoyments else</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Superiour and unmov’d, here onely weake</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Against the charm of Beauties powerful glance.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Or Nature faild in mee, and left some part</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Not proof enough such Object to sustain,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Or from my side subducting, took perhaps</span>
					<br/>
					<span>More then enough; at least on her bestow’d</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Too much of Ornament, in outward shew</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Elaborate, of inward less exact.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For well I understand in the prime end</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of Nature her th’ inferiour, in the mind</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And inward Faculties, which most excell,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In outward also her resembling less</span>
					<br/>
					<span>His Image who made both, and less expressing</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The character of that Dominion giv’n</span>
					<br/>
					<span>O’re other Creatures; yet when I approach</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Her loveliness, so absolute she seems</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And in her self compleat, so well to know</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Her own, that what she wills to do or say,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Seems wisest, vertuousest, discreetest, best;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>All higher knowledge in her presence falls</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Degraded, Wisdom in discourse with her</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Looses discount’nanc’t, and like folly shewes;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Authoritie and Reason on her waite,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As one intended first, not after made</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Occasionally; and to consummate all,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Greatness of mind and nobleness thir seat</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Build in her loveliest, and create an awe</span>
					<br/>
					<span>About her, as a guard Angelic plac’t.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To whom the Angel with contracted brow.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Accuse not Nature, she hath don her part;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Do thou but thine, and be not diffident</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of Wisdom, she deserts thee not, if thou</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Dismiss not her, when most thou needst her nigh,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>By attributing overmuch to things</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Less excellent, as thou thy self perceav’st.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For what admir’st thou, what transports thee so,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>An outside? fair no doubt, and worthy well</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thy cherishing, thy honouring, and thy love,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Not thy subjection: weigh with her thy self;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Then value: Oft times nothing profits more</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Then self-esteem, grounded on just and right</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Well manag’d; of that skill the more thou know’st,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The more she will acknowledge thee her Head,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And to realities yeild all her shows;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Made so adorn for thy delight the more,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>So awful, that with honour thou maist love</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thy mate, who sees when thou art seen least wise.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But if the sense of touch whereby mankind</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Is propagated seem such dear delight</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Beyond all other, think the same voutsaf’t</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To Cattel and each Beast; which would not be</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To them made common &amp; divulg’d, if aught</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Therein enjoy’d were worthy to subdue</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The Soule of Man, or passion in him move.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>What higher in her societie thou findst</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Attractive, human, rational, love still;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In loving thou dost well, in passion not,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Wherein true Love consists not; love refines</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The thoughts, and heart enlarges, hath his seat</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In Reason, and is judicious, is the scale</span>
					<br/>
					<span>By which to heav’nly Love thou maist ascend,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Not sunk in carnal pleasure, for which cause</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Among the Beasts no Mate for thee was found.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>To whom thus half abash’t <i>Adam</i> repli’d.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Neither her out-side formd so fair, nor aught</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In procreation common to all kindes</span>
					<br/>
					<span>(Though higher of the genial Bed by far,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And with mysterious reverence I deem)</span>
					<br/>
					<span>So much delights me, as those graceful acts,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Those thousand decencies that daily flow</span>
					<br/>
					<span>From all her words and actions, mixt with Love</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And sweet compliance, which declare unfeign’d</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Union of Mind, or in us both one Soule;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Harmonie to behold in wedded pair</span>
					<br/>
					<span>More grateful then harmonious sound to the eare.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Yet these subject not; I to thee disclose</span>
					<br/>
					<span>What inward thence I feel, not therefore foild,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Who meet with various objects, from the sense</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Variously representing; yet still free</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Approve the best, and follow what I approve.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To love thou blam’st me not, for love thou saist</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Leads up to Heav’n, is both the way and guide;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Bear with me then, if lawful what I ask;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Love not the heav’nly Spirits, and how thir Love</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Express they, by looks onely, or do they mix</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Irradiance, virtual or immediate touch?</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>To whom the Angel with a smile that glow’d</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Celestial rosie red, Loves proper hue,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Answer’d.  Let it suffice thee that thou know’st</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Us happie, and without Love no happiness.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Whatever pure thou in the body enjoy’st</span>
					<br/>
					<span>(And pure thou wert created) we enjoy</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In eminence, and obstacle find none</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of membrane, joynt, or limb, exclusive barrs:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Easier then Air with Air, if Spirits embrace,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Total they mix, Union of Pure with Pure</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Desiring; nor restrain’d conveyance need</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As Flesh to mix with Flesh, or Soul with Soul.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But I can now no more; the parting Sun</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Beyond the Earths green Cape and verdant Isles</span>
					<br/>
					<span><i>Hesperean</i> sets, my Signal to depart.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Be strong, live happie, and love, but first of all</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Him whom to love is to obey, and keep</span>
					<br/>
					<span>His great command; take heed least Passion sway</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thy Judgement to do aught, which else free Will</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Would not admit; thine and of all thy Sons</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The weal or woe in thee is plac’t; beware.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I in thy persevering shall rejoyce,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And all the Blest: stand fast; to stand or fall</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Free in thine own Arbitrement it lies.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Perfet within, no outward aid require;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And all temptation to transgress repel.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>So saying, he arose; whom <i>Adam</i> thus</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Follow’d with benediction.  Since to part,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Go heavenly Guest, Ethereal Messenger,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Sent from whose sovran goodness I adore.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Gentle to me and affable hath been</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thy condescension, and shall be honour’d ever</span>
					<br/>
					<span>With grateful Memorie: thou to mankind</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Be good and friendly still, and oft return.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>So parted they, the Angel up to Heav’n</span>
					<br/>
					<span>From the thick shade, and <i>Adam</i> to his Bowre.</span>
