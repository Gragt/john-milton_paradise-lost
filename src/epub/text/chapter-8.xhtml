						<span>No more of talk where God or Angel Guest</span>
						<br/>
						<span>With Man, as with his Friend, familiar us’d</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To sit indulgent, and with him partake</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Rural repast, permitting him the while</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Venial discourse unblam’d: I now must change</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Those Notes to Tragic; foul distrust, and breach</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Disloyal on the part of Man, revolt</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And disobedience: On the part of Heav’n</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Now alienated, distance and distaste,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Anger and just rebuke, and judgement giv’n,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That brought into this World a world of woe,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Sinne and her shadow Death, and Miserie</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Deaths Harbinger: Sad task, yet argument</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Not less but more Heroic then the wrauth</span>

						<span>Of stern <i>Achilles</i> on his Foe pursu’d</span>

						<span>Perplex’d the <i>Greek</i> and <i>Cytherea’s</i> Son;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>If answerable style I can obtaine</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of my Celestial Patroness, who deignes</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Her nightly visitation unimplor’d,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And dictates to me slumbring, or inspires</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Easie my unpremeditated Verse:</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Since first this subject for Heroic Song</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Pleas’d me long choosing, and beginning late;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Not sedulous by Nature to indite</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Warrs, hitherto the onely Argument</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Heroic deem’d, chief maistrie to dissect</span>
						<br/>
						<span>With long and tedious havoc fabl’d Knights</span>
						<br/>
						<span>In Battels feign’d; the better fortitude</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of Patience and Heroic Martyrdom</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Unsung; or to describe Races and Games,</span>

						<span>Or tilting Furniture, emblazon’d Shields,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Impreses quaint, Caparisons and Steeds;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Bases and tinsel Trappings, gorgious Knights</span>

						<span>At Joust and Torneament; then marshal’d Feast</span>

						<span>Serv’d up in Hall with Sewers, and Seneshals;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The skill of Artifice or Office mean,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Not that which justly gives Heroic name</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To Person or to Poem.  Mee of these</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Nor skilld nor studious, higher Argument</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Remaines, sufficient of it self to raise</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That name, unless an age too late, or cold</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Climat, or Years damp my intended wing</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Deprest, and much they may, if all be mine,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Not Hers who brings it nightly to my Ear.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>The Sun was sunk, and after him the Starr</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of <i>Hesperus</i>, whose Office is to bring</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Twilight upon the Earth, short Arbiter</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Twixt Day and Night, and now from end to end</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Nights Hemisphere had veild the Horizon round:</span>
						<br/>
						<span>When <i>Satan</i> who late fled before the threats</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of <i>Gabriel</i> out of <i>Eden</i>, now improv’d</span>
						<br/>
						<span>In meditated fraud and malice, bent</span>
						<br/>
						<span>On mans destruction, maugre what might hap</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of heavier on himself, fearless return’d.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>By Night he fled, and at Midnight return’d</span>
						<br/>
						<span>From compassing the Earth, cautious of day,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Since <i>Uriel</i> Regent of the Sun descri’d</span>
						<br/>
						<span>His entrance, and forewarnd the Cherubim</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That kept thir watch; thence full of anguish driv’n,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The space of seven continu’d Nights he rode</span>
						<br/>
						<span>With darkness, thrice the Equinoctial Line</span>
						<br/>
						<span>He circl’d, four times cross’d the Carr of Night</span>
						<br/>
						<span>From Pole to Pole, traversing each Colure;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>On the eighth return’d, and on the Coast averse</span>
						<br/>
						<span>From entrance or Cherubic Watch, by stealth</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Found unsuspected way.  There was a place,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Now not, though Sin, not Time, first wraught the change,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Where <i>Tigris</i> at the foot of Paradise</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Into a Gulf shot under ground, till part</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Rose up a Fountain by the Tree of Life;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>In with the River sunk, and with it rose</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Satan involv’d in rising Mist, then sought</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Where to lie hid; Sea he had searcht and Land</span>
						<br/>
						<span>From <i>Eden</i> over <i>Pontus</i>, and the Poole</span>
						<br/>
						<span><i>Maeotis</i>, up beyond the River <i>Ob</i>;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Downward as farr Antartic; and in length</span>
						<br/>
						<span>West from <i>Orantes</i> to the Ocean barr’d</span>
						<br/>
						<span>At <i>Darien</i>, thence to the Land where flowes</span>
						<br/>
						<span><i>Ganges</i> and <i>Indus:</i> thus the Orb he roam’d</span>
						<br/>
						<span>With narrow search; and with inspection deep</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Consider’d every Creature, which of all</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Most opportune might serve his Wiles, and found</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The Serpent suttlest Beast of all the Field.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Him after long debate, irresolute</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of thoughts revolv’d, his final sentence chose</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Fit Vessel, fittest Imp of fraud, in whom</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To enter, and his dark suggestions hide</span>
						<br/>
						<span>From sharpest sight: for in the wilie Snake,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Whatever sleights none would suspicious mark,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>As from his wit and native suttletie</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Proceeding, which in other Beasts observ’d</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Doubt might beget of Diabolic pow’r</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Active within beyond the sense of brute.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Thus he resolv’d, but first from inward griefe</span>
						<br/>
						<span>His bursting passion into plaints thus pour’d:</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>O Earth, how like to Heav’n, if not preferrd</span>
						<br/>
						<span>More justly, Seat worthier of Gods, as built</span>
						<br/>
						<span>With second thoughts, reforming what was old!</span>
						<br/>
						<span>For what God after better worse would build?</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Terrestrial Heav’n, danc’t round by other Heav’ns</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That shine, yet bear thir bright officious Lamps,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Light above Light, for thee alone, as seems,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>In thee concentring all thir precious beams</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of sacred influence: As God in Heav’n</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Is Center, yet extends to all, so thou</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Centring receav’st from all those Orbs; in thee,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Not in themselves, all thir known vertue appeers</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Productive in Herb, Plant, and nobler birth</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of Creatures animate with gradual life</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of Growth, Sense, Reason, all summ’d up in Man.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>With what delight could I have walkt thee round</span>
						<br/>
						<span>If I could joy in aught, sweet interchange</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of Hill and Vallie, Rivers, Woods and Plaines,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Now Land, now Sea, &amp; Shores with Forrest crownd,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Rocks, Dens, and Caves; but I in none of these</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Find place or refuge; and the more I see</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Pleasures about me, so much more I feel</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Torment within me, as from the hateful siege</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of contraries; all good to me becomes</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Bane, and in Heav’n much worse would be my state.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>But neither here seek I, no nor in Heav’n</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To dwell, unless by maistring Heav’ns Supreame;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Nor hope to be my self less miserable</span>
						<br/>
						<span>By what I seek, but others to make such</span>
						<br/>
						<span>As I though thereby worse to me redound:</span>
						<br/>
						<span>For onely in destroying I finde ease</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To my relentless thoughts; and him destroyd,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Or won to what may work his utter loss,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>For whom all this was made, all this will soon</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Follow, as to him linkt in weal or woe,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>In wo then; that destruction wide may range:</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To mee shall be the glorie sole among</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The infernal Powers, in one day to have marr’d</span>
						<br/>
						<span>What he <i>Almightie</i> styl’d, six Nights and Days</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Continu’d making, and who knows how long</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Before had bin contriving, though perhaps</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Not longer then since I in one Night freed</span>
						<br/>
						<span>From servitude inglorious welnigh half</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Th’ Angelic Name, and thinner left the throng</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of his adorers: hee to be aveng’d,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And to repaire his numbers thus impair’d,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Whether such vertue spent of old now faild</span>
						<br/>
						<span>More Angels to Create, if they at least</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Are his Created or to spite us more,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Determin’d to advance into our room</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A Creature form’d of Earth, and him endow,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Exalted from so base original,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>With Heav’nly spoils, our spoils: What he decreed</span>
						<br/>
						<span>He effected; Man he made, and for him built</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Magnificent this World, and Earth his seat,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Him Lord pronounc’d, and, O indignitie!</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Subjected to his service Angel wings,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And flaming Ministers to watch and tend</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Thir earthlie Charge: Of these the vigilance</span>
						<br/>
						<span>I dread, and to elude, thus wrapt in mist</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of midnight vapor glide obscure, and prie</span>
						<br/>
						<span>In every Bush and Brake, where hap may finde</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The Serpent sleeping, in whose mazie foulds</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To hide me, and the dark intent I bring.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>O foul descent! that I who erst contended</span>
						<br/>
						<span>With Gods to sit the highest, am now constraind</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Into a Beast, and mixt with bestial slime,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>This essence to incarnate and imbrute,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That to the hight of Deitie aspir’d;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>But what will not Ambition and Revenge</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Descend to? who aspires must down as low</span>
						<br/>
						<span>As high he soard, obnoxious first or last</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To basest things.  Revenge, at first though sweet,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Bitter ere long back on it self recoiles;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Let it; I reck not, so it light well aim’d,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Since higher I fall short, on him who next</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Provokes my envie, this new Favorite</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of Heav’n, this Man of Clay, Son of despite,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Whom us the more to spite his Maker rais’d</span>
						<br/>
						<span>From dust: spite then with spite is best repaid.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>So saying, through each Thicket Danck or Drie,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Like a black mist low creeping, he held on</span>
						<br/>
						<span>His midnight search, where soonest he might finde</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The Serpent: him fast sleeping soon he found</span>
						<br/>
						<span>In Labyrinth of many a round self-rowl’d,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>His head the midst, well stor’d with suttle wiles:</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Not yet in horrid Shade or dismal Den,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Not nocent yet, but on the grassie Herbe</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Fearless unfeard he slept: in at his Mouth</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The Devil enterd, and his brutal sense,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>In heart or head, possessing soon inspir’d</span>
						<br/>
						<span>With act intelligential; but his sleep</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Disturbd not, waiting close th’ approach of Morn.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Now whenas sacred Light began to dawne</span>
						<br/>
						<span>In <i>Eden</i> on the humid Flours, that breathd</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Thir morning Incense, when all things that breath,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>From th’ Earths great Altar send up silent praise</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To the Creator, and his Nostrils fill</span>
						<br/>
						<span>With gratefull Smell, forth came the human pair</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And joynd thir vocal Worship to the Quire</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of Creatures wanting voice, that done, partake</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The season, prime for sweetest Sents and Aires:</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Then commune how that day they best may ply</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Thir growing work: for much thir work outgrew</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The hands dispatch of two Gardning so wide.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And <i>Eve</i> first to her Husband thus began.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span><i>Adam</i>, well may we labour still to dress</span>
						<br/>
						<span>This Garden, still to tend Plant, Herb and Flour.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Our pleasant task enjoyn’d, but till more hands</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Aid us, the work under our labour grows,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Luxurious by restraint; what we by day</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Lop overgrown, or prune, or prop, or bind,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>One night or two with wanton growth derides</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Tending to wilde.  Thou therefore now advise</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Or hear what to my mind first thoughts present,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Let us divide our labours, thou where choice</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Leads thee, or where most needs, whether to wind</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The Woodbine round this Arbour, or direct</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The clasping Ivie where to climb, while I</span>
						<br/>
						<span>In yonder Spring of Roses intermixt</span>
						<br/>
						<span>With Myrtle, find what to redress till Noon:</span>
						<br/>
						<span>For while so near each other thus all day</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Our task we choose, what wonder if no near</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Looks intervene and smiles, or object new</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Casual discourse draw on, which intermits</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Our dayes work brought to little, though begun</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Early, and th’ hour of Supper comes unearn’d.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>To whom mild answer <i>Adam</i> thus return’d.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Sole <i>Eve</i>, Associate sole, to me beyond</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Compare above all living Creatures deare,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Well hast thou motion’d, wel thy thoughts imployd</span>
						<br/>
						<span>How we might best fulfill the work which here</span>
						<br/>
						<span>God hath assign’d us, nor of me shalt pass</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Unprais’d: for nothing lovelier can be found</span>
						<br/>
						<span>In woman, then to studie houshold good,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And good workes in her Husband to promote.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Yet not so strictly hath our Lord impos’d</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Labour, as to debarr us when we need</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Refreshment, whether food, or talk between,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Food of the mind, or this sweet intercourse</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of looks and smiles, for smiles from Reason flow,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To brute deni’d, and are of Love the food,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Love not the lowest end of human life.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>For not to irksom toile, but to delight</span>
						<br/>
						<span>He made us, and delight to Reason joyn’d.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>These paths and Bowers doubt not but our joynt</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Will keep from Wilderness with ease, as wide</span>
						<br/>
						<span>As we need walk, till younger hands ere long</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Assist us: But if much converse perhaps</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Thee satiate, to short absence I could yeild.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>For solitude somtimes is best societie,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And short retirement urges sweet returne.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>But other doubt possesses me, least harm</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Befall thee sever’d from me; for thou knowst</span>
						<br/>
						<span>What hath bin warn’d us, what malicious Foe</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Envying our happiness, and of his own</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Despairing, seeks to work us woe and shame</span>
						<br/>
						<span>By sly assault; and somwhere nigh at hand</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Watches, no doubt, with greedy hope to find</span>
						<br/>
						<span>His wish and best advantage, us asunder,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Hopeless to circumvent us joynd, where each</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To other speedie aide might lend at need;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Whether his first design be to withdraw</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Our fealtie from God, or to disturb</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Conjugal Love, then which perhaps no bliss</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Enjoy’d by us excites his envie more;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Or this, or worse, leave not the faithful side</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That gave thee being, stil shades thee and protects.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The Wife, where danger or dishonour lurks,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Safest and seemliest by her Husband staies,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Who guards her, or with her the worst endures.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>To whom the Virgin Majestie of <i>Eve</i>,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>As one who loves, and some unkindness meets,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>With sweet austeer composure thus reply’d.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>Ofspring of Heav’n and Earth, and all Earths Lord,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That such an enemie we have, who seeks</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Our ruin, both by thee informd I learne,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And from the parting Angel over-heard</span>
						<br/>
						<span>As in a shadie nook I stood behind,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Just then returnd at shut of Evening Flours.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>But that thou shouldst my firmness therefore doubt</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To God or thee, because we have a foe</span>
						<br/>
						<span>May tempt it, I expected not to hear.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>His violence thou fearst not, being such,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>As wee, not capable of death or paine,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Can either not receave, or can repell.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>His fraud is then thy fear, which plain inferrs</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Thy equal fear that my firm Faith and Love</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Can by his fraud be shak’n or seduc’t;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Thoughts, which how found they harbour in thy Brest,</span>
						<br/>
						<span><i>Adam</i>, misthought of her to thee so dear?</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>To whom with healing words <i>Adam</i> reply’d.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Daughter of God and Man, immortal <i>Eve</i>,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>For such thou art, from sin and blame entire:</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Not diffident of thee do I dissuade</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Thy absence from my sight, but to avoid</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Th’ attempt it self, intended by our Foe.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>For hee who tempts, though in vain, at least asperses</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The tempted with dishonour foul, suppos’d</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Not incorruptible of Faith, not prooff</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Against temptation: thou thy self with scorne</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And anger wouldst resent the offer’d wrong,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Though ineffectual found: misdeem not then,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>If such affront I labour to avert</span>
						<br/>
						<span>From thee alone, which on us both at once</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The Enemie, though bold, will hardly dare,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Or daring, first on mee th’ assault shall light.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Nor thou his malice and false guile contemn;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Suttle he needs must be, who could seduce</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Angels, nor think superfluous others aid.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>I from the influence of thy looks receave</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Access in every Vertue, in thy sight</span>
						<br/>
						<span>More wise, more watchful, stronger, if need were</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of outward strength; while shame, thou looking on,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Shame to be overcome or over-reacht</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Would utmost vigor raise, and rais’d unite.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Why shouldst not thou like sense within thee feel</span>
						<br/>
						<span>When I am present, and thy trial choose</span>
						<br/>
						<span>With me, best witness of thy Vertue tri’d.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>So spake domestick <i>Adam</i> in his care</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And Matrimonial Love, but <i>Eve</i>, who thought</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Less attributed to her Faith sincere,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Thus her reply with accent sweet renewd.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>If this be our condition, thus to dwell</span>
						<br/>
						<span>In narrow circuit strait’nd by a Foe,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Suttle or violent, we not endu’d</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Single with like defence, wherever met,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>How are we happie, still in fear of harm?</span>
						<br/>
						<span>But harm precedes not sin: onely our Foe</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Tempting affronts us with his foul esteem</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of our integritie: his foul esteeme</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Sticks no dishonor on our Front, but turns</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Foul on himself; then wherfore shund or feard</span>
						<br/>
						<span>By us? who rather double honour gaine</span>
						<br/>
						<span>From his surmise prov’d false, finde peace within,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Favour from Heav’n, our witness from th’ event.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And what is Faith, Love, Vertue unassaid</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Alone, without exterior help sustaind?</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Let us not then suspect our happie State</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Left so imperfet by the Maker wise,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>As not secure to single or combin’d.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Fraile is our happiness, if this be so,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And <i>Eden</i> were no <i>Eden</i> thus expos’d.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>To whom thus <i>Adam</i> fervently repli’d.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>O Woman, best are all things as the will</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of God ordaind them, his creating hand</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Nothing imperfet or deficient left</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of all that he Created, much less Man,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Or ought that might his happie State secure,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Secure from outward force; within himself</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The danger lies, yet lies within his power:</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Against his will he can receave no harme.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>But God left free the Will, for what obeyes</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Reason, is free, and Reason he made right,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>But bid her well beware, and still erect,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Least by some faire appeering good surpris’d</span>
						<br/>
						<span>She dictate false, and missinforme the Will</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To do what God expresly hath forbid.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Not then mistrust, but tender love enjoynes,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That I should mind thee oft, and mind thou me.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Firm we subsist, yet possible to swerve,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Since Reason not impossibly may meet</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Some specious object by the Foe subornd,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And fall into deception unaware,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Not keeping strictest watch, as she was warnd.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Seek not temptation then, which to avoide</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Were better, and most likelie if from mee</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Thou sever not; Trial will come unsought.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Wouldst thou approve thy constancie, approve</span>
						<br/>
						<span>First thy obedience; th’ other who can know,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Not seeing thee attempted, who attest?</span>
						<br/>
						<span>But if thou think, trial unsought may finde</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Us both securer then thus warnd thou seemst,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Go; for thy stay, not free, absents thee more;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Go in thy native innocence, relie</span>
						<br/>
						<span>On what thou hast of vertue, summon all,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>For God towards thee hath done his part, do thine.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>So spake the Patriarch of Mankinde, but <i>Eve</i></span>
						<br/>
						<span>Persisted, yet submiss, though last, repli’d.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>With thy permission then, and thus forewarnd</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Chiefly by what thy own last reasoning words</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Touchd onely, that our trial, when least sought,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>May finde us both perhaps farr less prepar’d,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The willinger I goe, nor much expect</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A Foe so proud will first the weaker seek;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>So bent, the more shall shame him his repulse.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Thus saying, from her Husbands hand her hand</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Soft she withdrew, and like a Wood-Nymph light</span>
						<br/>
						<span><i>Oread</i> or <i>Dryad</i>, or of <i>Delia’s</i> Traine,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Betook her to the Groves, but <i>Delia’s</i> self</span>
						<br/>
						<span>In gate surpass’d and Goddess-like deport,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Though not as shee with Bow and Quiver armd,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>But with such Gardning Tools as Are yet rude,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Guiltless of fire had formd, or Angels brought,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To <i>Pales</i>, or <i>Pomona</i>, thus adornd,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Likest she seemd, <i>Pomona</i> when she fled</span>
						<br/>
						<span><i>Vertumnus</i>, or to <i>Ceres</i> in her Prime,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Yet Virgin of <i>Proserpina</i> from <i>Jove</i>.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Her long with ardent look his <i>Eye</i> pursu’d</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Delighted, but desiring more her stay.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Oft he to her his charge of quick returne,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Repeated, shee to him as oft engag’d</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To be returnd by Noon amid the Bowre,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And all things in best order to invite</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Noontide repast, or Afternoons repose.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>O much deceav’d, much failing, hapless <i>Eve</i>,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of thy presum’d return! event perverse!</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Thou never from that houre in Paradise</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Foundst either sweet repast, or found repose;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Such ambush hid among sweet Flours and Shades</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Waited with hellish rancor imminent</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To intercept thy way, or send thee back</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Despoild of Innocence, of Faith, of Bliss.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>For now, and since first break of dawne the Fiend,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Meer Serpent in appearance, forth was come,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And on his Quest, where likeliest he might finde</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The onely two of Mankinde, but in them</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The whole included Race, his purposd prey.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>In Bowre and Field he sought, where any tuft</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of Grove or Garden-Plot more pleasant lay,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Thir tendance or Plantation for delight,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>By Fountain or by shadie Rivulet</span>
						<br/>
						<span>He sought them both, but wish’d his hap might find</span>
						<br/>
						<span><i>Eve</i> separate, he wish’d, but not with hope</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of what so seldom chanc’d, when to his wish,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Beyond his hope, <i>Eve</i> separate he spies,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Veild in a Cloud of Fragrance, where she stood,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Half spi’d, so thick the Roses bushing round</span>
						<br/>
						<span>About her glowd, oft stooping to support</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Each Flour of slender stalk, whose head though gay</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Carnation, Purple, Azure, or spect with Gold,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Hung drooping unsustaind, them she upstaies</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Gently with Mirtle band, mindless the while,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Her self, though fairest unsupported Flour,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>From her best prop so farr, and storn so nigh.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Neererhe drew, and many a walk travers’d</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of stateliest Covert, Cedar, Pine, or Palme,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Then voluble and bold, now hid, now seen</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Among thick-wov’n Arborets and Flours</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Imborderd on each Bank, the hand of <i>Eve</i>:</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Spot more delicious then those Gardens feign’d</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Or of reviv’d <i>Adonis</i>, or renownd</span>
						<br/>
						<span><i>Alcinous</i>, host of old <i>Laertes</i> Son,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Or that, not Mystic, where the Sapient King</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Held dalliance with his faire <i>Egyptian</i> Spouse.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Much hee the Place admir’d, the Person more.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>As one who long in populous City pent,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Where Houses thick and Sewers annoy the Aire,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Forth issuing on a Summers Morn, to breathe</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Among the pleasant Villages and Farmes</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Adjoynd, from each thing met conceaves delight,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The smell of Grain, or tedded Grass, or Kine,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Or Dairie, each rural sight, each rural sound;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>If chance with Nymphlike step fair Virgin pass,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>What pleasing seemd, for her now pleases more,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>She most, and in her look summs all Delight.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Such Pleasure took the Serpent to behold</span>
						<br/>
						<span>This Flourie Plat, the sweet recess of <i>Eve</i></span>
						<br/>
						<span>Thus earlie, thus alone; her Heav’nly forme</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Angelic, but more soft, and Feminine,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Her graceful Innocence, her every Aire</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of gesture or lest action overawd</span>
						<br/>
						<span>His Malice, and with rapine sweet bereav’d</span>
						<br/>
						<span>His fierceness of the fierce intent it brought:</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That space the Evil one abstracted stood</span>
						<br/>
						<span>From his own evil, and for the time remaind</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Stupidly good, of enmitie disarm’d,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of guile, of hate, of envie, of revenge;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>But the hot Hell that alwayes in him burnes,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Though in mid Heav’n, soon ended his delight,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And tortures him now more, the more he sees</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of pleasure not for him ordain’d: then soon</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Fierce hate he recollects, and all his thoughts</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of mischief, gratulating, thus excites.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>Thoughts, whither have he led me, with what sweet</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Compulsion thus transported to forget</span>
						<br/>
						<span>What hither brought us, hate, not love, nor hope</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of Paradise for Hell, hope here to taste</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of pleasure, but all pleasure to destroy,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Save what is in destroying, other joy</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To me is lost.  Then let me not let pass</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Occasion which now smiles, behold alone</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The Woman, opportune to all attempts,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Her Husband, for I view far round, not nigh,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Whose higher intellectual more I shun,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And strength, of courage hautie, and of limb</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Heroic built, though of terrestrial mould,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Foe not informidable, exempt from wound,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>I not; so much hath Hell debas’d, and paine</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Infeebl’d me, to what I was in Heav’n.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Shee fair, divinely fair, fit Love for Gods,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Not terrible, though terrour be in Love</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And beautie, not approacht by stronger hate,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Hate stronger, under shew of Love well feign’d,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The way which to her ruin now I tend.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>So spake the Enemie of Mankind, enclos’d</span>
						<br/>
						<span>In Serpent, Inmate bad, and toward <i>Eve</i></span>
						<br/>
						<span>Address’d his way, not with indented wave,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Prone on the ground, as since, but on his reare,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Circular base of rising foulds, that tour’d</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Fould above fould a surging Maze, his Head</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Crested aloft, and Carbuncle his Eyes;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>With burnisht Neck of verdant Gold, erect</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Amidst his circling Spires, that on the grass</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Floted redundant: pleasing was his shape,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And lovely, never since of Serpent kind</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Lovelier, not those that in <i>Illyria</i> chang’d</span>
						<br/>
						<span><i>Hermione</i> and <i>Cadmus</i>, or the God</span>
						<br/>
						<span>In <i>Epidaurus</i>; nor to which transformd</span>
						<br/>
						<span><i>Ammonian Jove</i>, or <i>Capitoline</i> was seen,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Hee with <i>Olympias</i>, this with her who bore</span>
						<br/>
						<span><i>Scipio</i> the highth of <i>Rome</i>.  With tract oblique</span>
						<br/>
						<span>At first, as one who sought access, but feard</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To interrupt, side-long he works his way.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>As when a Ship by skilful Stearsman wrought</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Nigh Rivers mouth or Foreland, where the Wind</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Veres oft, as oft so steers, and shifts her Saile;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>So varied hee, and of his tortuous Traine</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Curld many a wanton wreath in sight of <i>Eve</i>,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To lure her Eye; shee busied heard the sound</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of rusling Leaves, but minded not, as us’d</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To such disport before her through the Field,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>From every Beast, more duteous at her call,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Then at <i>Circean</i> call the Herd disguis’d.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Hee boulder now, uncall’d before her stood;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>But as in gaze admiring: Oft he bowd</span>
						<br/>
						<span>His turret Crest, and sleek enamel’d Neck,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Fawning, and lick’d the ground whereon she trod.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>His gentle dumb expression turnd at length</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The Eye of <i>Eve</i> to mark his play; he glad</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of her attention gaind, with Serpent Tongue</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Organic, or impulse of vocal Air,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>His fraudulent temptation thus began.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>Wonder not, sovran Mistress, if perhaps</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Thou canst, who art sole Wonder, much less arm</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Thy looks, the Heav’n of mildness, with disdain,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Displeas’d that I approach thee thus, and gaze</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Insatiate, I thus single; nor have feard</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Thy awful brow, more awful thus retir’d.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Fairest resemblance of thy Maker faire,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Thee all living things gaze on, all things thine</span>
						<br/>
						<span>By gift, and thy Celestial Beautie adore</span>
						<br/>
						<span>With ravishment beheld, there best beheld</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Where universally admir’d; but here</span>
						<br/>
						<span>In this enclosure wild, these Beasts among,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Beholders rude, and shallow to discerne</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Half what in thee is fair, one man except,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Who sees thee? (and what is one?) who shouldst be seen</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A Goddess among Gods, ador’d and serv’d</span>
						<br/>
						<span>By Angels numberless, thy daily Train.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>So gloz’d the Tempter, and his Proem tun’d;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Into the Heart of <i>Eve</i> his words made way,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Though at the voice much marveling; at length</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Not unamaz’d she thus in answer spake.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>What may this mean?  Language of Man pronounc’t</span>
						<br/>
						<span>By Tongue of Brute, and human sense exprest?</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The first at lest of these I thought deni’d</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To Beasts, whom God on their Creation-Day</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Created mute to all articulat sound;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The latter I demurre, for in thir looks</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Much reason, and in thir actions oft appeers.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Thee, Serpent, suttlest beast of all the field</span>
						<br/>
						<span>I knew, but not with human voice endu’d;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Redouble then this miracle, and say,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>How cam’st thou speakable of mute, and how</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To me so friendly grown above the rest</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of brutal kind, that daily are in sight?</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Say, for such wonder claims attention due.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>To whom the guileful Tempter thus reply’d.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Empress of this fair World, resplendent <i>Eve</i>,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Easie to mee it is to tell thee all</span>
						<br/>
						<span>What thou commandst, and right thou shouldst be obeyd:</span>
						<br/>
						<span>I was at first as other Beasts that graze</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The trodden Herb, of abject thoughts and low,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>As was my food, nor aught but food discern’d</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Or Sex, and apprehended nothing high:</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Till on a day roaving the field, I chanc’d</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A goodly Tree farr distant to behold</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Loaden with fruit of fairest colours mixt,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Ruddie and Gold: I nearer drew to gaze;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>When from the boughes a savorie odour blow’n,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Grateful to appetite, more pleas’d my sense</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Then smell of sweetest Fenel, or the Teats</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of Ewe or Goat dropping with Milk at Eevn,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Unsuckt of Lamb or Kid, that tend thir play.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To satisfie the sharp desire I had</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of tasting those fair Apples, I resolv’d</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Not to deferr; hunger and thirst at once,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Powerful perswaders, quick’nd at the scent</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of that alluring fruit, urg’d me so keene.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>About the Mossie Trunk I wound me soon,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>For high from ground the branches would require</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Thy utmost reach or <i>Adams</i>: Round the Tree</span>
						<br/>
						<span>All other Beasts that saw, with like desire</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Longing and envying stood, but could not reach.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Amid the Tree now got, where plentie hung</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Tempting so nigh, to pluck and eat my fill</span>
						<br/>
						<span>I spar’d not, for such pleasure till that hour</span>
						<br/>
						<span>At Feed or Fountain never had I found.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Sated at length, ere long I might perceave</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Strange alteration in me, to degree</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of Reason in my inward Powers, and Speech</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Wanted not long, though to this shape retaind.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Thenceforth to Speculations high or deep</span>
						<br/>
						<span>I turnd my thoughts, and with capacious mind</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Considerd all things visible in Heav’n,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Or Earth, or Middle, all things fair and good;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>But all that fair and good in thy Divine</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Semblance, and in thy Beauties heav’nly Ray</span>
						<br/>
						<span>United I beheld; no Fair to thine</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Equivalent or second, which compel’d</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Mee thus, though importune perhaps, to come</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And gaze, and worship thee of right declar’d</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Sovran of Creatures, universal Dame.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>So talk’d the spirited sly Snake; and <i>Eve</i></span>
						<br/>
						<span>Yet more amaz’d unwarie thus reply’d.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>Serpent, thy overpraising leaves in doubt</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The vertue of that Fruit, in thee first prov’d:</span>
						<br/>
						<span>But say, where grows the Tree, from hence how far?</span>
						<br/>
						<span>For many are the Trees of God that grow</span>
						<br/>
						<span>In Paradise, and various, yet unknown</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To us, in such abundance lies our choice,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>As leaves a greater store of Fruit untoucht,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Still hanging incorruptible, till men</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Grow up to thir provision, and more hands</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Help to disburden Nature of her Bearth.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>To whom the wilie Adder, blithe and glad.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Empress, the way is readie, and not long,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Beyond a row of Myrtles, on a Flat,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Fast by a Fountain, one small Thicket past</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of blowing Myrrh and Balme; if thou accept</span>
						<br/>
						<span>My conduct, I can bring thee thither soon.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>Lead then, said <i>Eve</i>.  Hee leading swiftly rowld</span>
						<br/>
						<span>In tangles, and make intricate seem strait,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To mischief swift.  Hope elevates, and joy</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Bright’ns his Crest, as when a wandring Fire</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Compact of unctuous vapor, which the Night</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Condenses, and the cold invirons round,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Kindl’d through agitation to a Flame,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Which oft, they say, some evil Spirit attends,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Hovering and blazing with delusive Light,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Misleads th’ amaz’d Night-wanderer from his way</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To Boggs and Mires, &amp; oft through Pond or Poole,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>There swallow’d up and lost, from succour farr.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>So glister’d the dire Snake and into fraud</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Led <i>Eve</i> our credulous Mother, to the Tree</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of prohibition, root of all our woe;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Which when she saw, thus to her guide she spake.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>Serpent, we might have spar’d our coming hither,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Fruitless to me, though Fruit be here to excess,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The credit of whose vertue rest with thee,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Wondrous indeed, if cause of such effects.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>But of this Tree we may not taste nor touch;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>God so commanded, and left that Command</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Sole Daughter of his voice; the rest, we live</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Law to our selves, our Reason is our Law.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>To whom the Tempter guilefully repli’d.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Indeed? hath God then said that of the Fruit</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of all these Garden Trees ye shall not eate,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Yet Lords declar’d of all in Earth or Aire?</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>To whom thus <i>Eve</i> yet sinless.  Of the Fruit</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of each Tree in the Garden we may eate,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>But of the Fruit of this fair Tree amidst</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The Garden, God hath said, Ye shall not eate</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Thereof, nor shall ye touch it, least ye die.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>She scarse had said, though brief, when now more bold</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The Tempter, but with shew of Zeale and Love</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To Man, and indignation at his wrong,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>New part puts on, and as to passion mov’d,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Fluctuats disturbd, yet comely, and in act</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Rais’d, as of som great matter to begin.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>As when of old som Orator renound</span>
						<br/>
						<span>In <i>Athens</i> or free <i>Rome</i>, where Eloquence</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Flourishd, since mute, to som great cause addrest,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Stood in himself collected, while each part,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Motion, each act won audience ere the tongue,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Somtimes in highth began, as no delay</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of Preface brooking through his Zeal of Right.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>So standing, moving, or to highth upgrown</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The Tempter all impassiond thus began.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>O Sacred, Wise, and Wisdom-giving Plant,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Mother of Science, Now I feel thy Power</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Within me cleere, not onely to discerne</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Things in thir Causes, but to trace the wayes</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of highest Agents, deemd however wise.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Queen of this Universe, doe not believe</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Those rigid threats of Death; ye shall not Die:</span>
						<br/>
						<span>How should ye? by the Fruit? it gives you Life</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To Knowledge?  By the Threatner, look on mee,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Mee who have touch’d and tasted, yet both live,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And life more perfet have attaind then Fate</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Meant mee, by ventring higher then my Lot.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Shall that be shut to Man, which to the Beast</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Is open? or will God incense his ire</span>
						<br/>
						<span>For such a pretty Trespass, and not praise</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Rather your dauntless vertue, whom the pain</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of Death denounc’t, whatever thing Death be,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Deterrd not from atchieving what might leade</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To happier life, knowledge of Good and Evil;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of good, how just? of evil, if what is evil</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Be real, why not known, since easier shunnd?</span>
						<br/>
						<span>God therefore cannot hurt ye, and be just;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Not just, not God; not feard then, nor obeid:</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Your feare it self of Death removes the feare.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Why then was this forbid?  Why but to awe,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Why but to keep ye low and ignorant,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>His worshippers; he knows that in the day</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Ye Eate thereof, your Eyes that seem so cleere,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Yet are but dim, shall perfetly be then</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Op’nd and cleerd, and ye shall be as Gods,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Knowing both Good and Evil as they know.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That ye should be as Gods, since I as Man,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Internal Man, is but proportion meet,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>I of brute human, yee of human Gods.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>So ye shalt die perhaps, by putting off</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Human, to put on Gods, death to be wisht,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Though threat’nd, which no worse then this can bring</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And what are Gods that Man may not become</span>
						<br/>
						<span>As they, participating God-like food?</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The Gods are first, and that advantage use</span>
						<br/>
						<span>On our belief, that all from them proceeds,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>I question it, for this fair Earth I see,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Warm’d by the Sun, producing every kind,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Them nothing: If they all things, who enclos’d</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Knowledge of Good and Evil in this Tree,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That whoso eats thereof, forthwith attains</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Wisdom without their leave? and wherein lies</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Th’ offence, that Man should thus attain to know?</span>
						<br/>
						<span>What can your knowledge hurt him, or this Tree</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Impart against his will if all be his?</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Or is it envie, and can envie dwell</span>
						<br/>
						<span>In heav’nly brests? these, these and many more</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Causes import your need of this fair Fruit.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Goddess humane, reach then, and freely taste.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>He ended, and his words replete with guile</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Into her heart too easie entrance won:</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Fixt on the Fruit she gaz’d, which to behold</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Might tempt alone, and in her ears the sound</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Yet rung of his perswasive words, impregn’d</span>
						<br/>
						<span>With Reason, to her seeming, and with Truth;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Meanwhile the hour of Noon drew on, and wak’d</span>
						<br/>
						<span>An eager appetite, rais’d by the smell</span>
						<br/>
						<span>So savorie of that Fruit, which with desire,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Inclinable now grown to touch or taste,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Sollicited her longing eye; yet first</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Pausing a while, thus to her self she mus’d.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>Great are thy Vertues, doubtless, best of Fruits,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Though kept from Man, &amp; worthy to be admir’d,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Whose taste, too long forborn, at first assay</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Gave elocution to the mute, and taught</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The Tongue not made for Speech to speak thy praise:</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Thy praise hee also who forbids thy use,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Conceales not from us, naming thee the Tree</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of Knowledge, knowledge both of good and evil;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Forbids us then to taste, but his forbidding</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Commends thee more, while it inferrs the good</span>
						<br/>
						<span>By thee communicated, and our want:</span>
						<br/>
						<span>For good unknown, sure is not had, or had</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And yet unknown, is as not had at all.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>In plain then, what forbids he but to know,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Forbids us good, forbids us to be wise?</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Such prohibitions binde not.  But if Death</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Bind us with after-bands, what profits then</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Our inward freedom?  In the day we eate</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of this fair Fruit, our doom is, we shall die.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>How dies the Serpent? hee hath eat’n and lives,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And knows, and speaks, and reasons, and discernes,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Irrational till then.  For us alone</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Was death invented? or to us deni’d</span>
						<br/>
						<span>This intellectual food, for beasts reserv’d?</span>
						<br/>
						<span>For Beasts it seems: yet that one Beast which first</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Hath tasted, envies not, but brings with joy</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The good befall’n him, Author unsuspect,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Friendly to man, farr from deceit or guile.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>What fear I then, rather what know to feare</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Under this ignorance of Good and Evil,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of God or Death, of Law or Penaltie?</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Here grows the Cure of all, this Fruit Divine,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Fair to the Eye, inviting to the Taste,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of vertue to make wise: what hinders then</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To reach, and feed at once both Bodie and Mind?</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>So saying, her rash hand in evil hour</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Forth reaching to the Fruit, she pluck’d, she eat:</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Earth felt the wound, and Nature from her seat</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Sighing through all her Works gave signs of woe,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That all was lost.  Back to the Thicket slunk</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The guiltie Serpent, and well might, for <i>Eve</i></span>
						<br/>
						<span>Intent now wholly on her taste, naught else</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Regarded, such delight till then, as seemd,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>In Fruit she never tasted, whether true</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Or fansied so, through expectation high</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of knowledg, nor was God-head from her thought.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Greedily she ingorg’d without restraint,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And knew not eating Death: Satiate at length,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And hight’nd as with Wine, jocond and boon,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Thus to her self she pleasingly began.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>O Sovran, vertuous, precious of all Trees</span>
						<br/>
						<span>In Paradise, of operation blest</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To Sapience, hitherto obscur’d, infam’d,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And thy fair Fruit let hang, as to no end</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Created; but henceforth my early care,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Not without Song, each Morning, and due praise</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Shall tend thee, and the fertil burden ease</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of thy full branches offer’d free to all;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Till dieted by thee I grow mature</span>
						<br/>
						<span>In knowledge, as the Gods who all things know;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Though others envie what they cannot give;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>For had the gift bin theirs, it had not here</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Thus grown.  Experience, next to thee I owe,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Best guide; not following thee, I had remaind</span>
						<br/>
						<span>In ignorance, thou op’nst Wisdoms way,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And giv’st access, though secret she retire.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And I perhaps am secret; Heav’n is high,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>High and remote to see from thence distinct</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Each thing on Earth; and other care perhaps</span>
						<br/>
						<span>May have diverted from continual watch</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Our great Forbidder, safe with all his Spies</span>
						<br/>
						<span>About him.  But to <i>Adam</i> in what sort</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Shall I appeer? shall I to him make known</span>
						<br/>
						<span>As yet my change, and give him to partake</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Full happiness with mee, or rather not,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>But keep the odds of Knowledge in my power</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Without Copartner? so to add what wants</span>
						<br/>
						<span>In Femal Sex, the more to draw his Love,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And render me more equal, and perhaps</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A thing not undesireable, somtime</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Superior; for inferior who is free?</span>
						<br/>
						<span>This may be well: but what if God have seen,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And Death ensue? then I shall be no more,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And <i>Adam</i> wedded to another <i>Eve</i>,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Shall live with her enjoying, I extinct;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A death to think.  Confirm’d then I resolve,</span>
						<br/>
						<span><i>Adam</i> shall share with me in bliss or woe:</span>
						<br/>
						<span>So dear I love him, that with him all deaths</span>
						<br/>
						<span>I could endure; without him live no life.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>So saying, from the Tree her step she turnd,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>But first low Reverence don, as to the power</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That dwelt within, whose presence had infus’d</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Into the plant sciential sap, deriv’d</span>
						<br/>
						<span>From Nectar, drink of Gods.  <i>Adam</i> the while</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Waiting desirous her return, had wove</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of choicest Flours a Garland to adorne</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Her Tresses, and her rural labours crown</span>
						<br/>
						<span>As Reapers oft are wont thir Harvest Queen.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Great joy he promis’d to his thoughts, and new</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Solace in her return, so long delay’d;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Yet oft his heart, divine of somthing ill,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Misgave him; hee the faultring measure felt;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And forth to meet her went, the way she took</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That Morn when first they parted; by the Tree</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of Knowledge he must pass, there he her met,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Scarse from the Tree returning; in her hand</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A bough of fairest fruit that downie smil’d,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>New gatherd, and ambrosial smell diffus’d.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To him she hasted, in her face excuse</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Came Prologue, and Apologie to prompt,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Which with bland words at will she thus addrest.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>Hast thou not wonderd, <i>Adam</i>, at my stay?</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Thee I have misst, and thought it long, depriv’d</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Thy presence, agonie of love till now</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Not felt, nor shall be twice, for never more</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Mean I to trie, what rash untri’d I sought,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The paine of absence from thy sight.  But strange</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Hath bin the cause, and wonderful to heare:</span>
						<br/>
						<span>This Tree is not as we are told, a Tree</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of danger tasted, nor to evil unknown</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Op’ning the way, but of Divine effect</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To open Eyes, and make them Gods who taste;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And hath bin tasted such; the Serpent wise,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Or not restraind as wee, or not obeying,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Hath eat’n of the fruit, and is become,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Not dead, as we are threatn’d, but thenceforth</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Endu’d with human voice and human sense,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Reasoning to admiration, and with mee</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Perswasively hath so prevaild, that I</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Have also tasted, and have also found</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Th’ effects to correspond, opener mine Eyes,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Dimm erst, dilated Spirits, ampler Heart,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And growing up to Godhead; which for thee</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Chiefly I sought, without thee can despise.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>For bliss, as thou hast part, to me is bliss,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Tedious, unshar’d with thee, and odious soon.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Thou therefore also taste, that equal Lot</span>
						<br/>
						<span>May joyne us, equal Joy, as equal Love;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Least thou not tasting, different degree</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Disjoyne us, and I then too late renounce</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Deitie for thee, when Fate will not permit.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>Thus <i>Eve</i> with Countnance blithe her storie told;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>But in her Cheek distemper flushing glowd.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>On th’ other side, <i>Adam</i>, soon as he heard</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The fatal Trespass don by <i>Eve</i>, amaz’d,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Astonied stood and Blank, while horror chill</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Ran through his veins, and all his joynts relax’d;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>From his slack hand the Garland wreath’d for <i>Eve</i></span>
						<br/>
						<span>Down drop’d, and all the faded Roses shed:</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Speechless he stood and pale, till thus at length</span>
						<br/>
						<span>First to himself he inward silence broke.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>O fairest of Creation, last and best</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of all Gods Works, Creature in whom excell’d</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Whatever can to fight or thought be found,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Holy, divine, good, amiable, or sweet!</span>
						<br/>
						<span>How art thou lost, how on a sudden lost,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Defac’t, deflourd, and now to Death devote?</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Rather how hast thou yeelded to transgress</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The strict forbiddance, how to violate</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The sacred Fruit forbidd’n! som cursed fraud</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of Enemie hath beguil’d thee, yet unknown,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And mee with thee hath ruind, for with thee</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Certain my resolution is to Die;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>How can I live without thee, how forgoe</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Thy sweet Converse and Love so dearly joyn’d,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To live again in these wilde Woods forlorn?</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Should God create another <i>Eve</i>, and I</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Another Rib afford, yet loss of thee</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Would never from my heart; no no, I feel</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The Link of Nature draw me: Flesh of Flesh,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Bone of my Bone thou art, and from thy State</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Mine never shall be parted, bliss or woe.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>So having said, as one from sad dismay</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Recomforted, and after thoughts disturbd</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Submitting to what seemd remediless,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Thus in calme mood his Words to <i>Eve</i> he turnd.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>Bold deed thou hast presum’d, adventrous <i>Eve</i>,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And peril great provok’t, who thus hast dar’d</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Had it bin onely coveting to Eye</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That sacred Fruit, sacred to abstinence,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Much more to taste it under banne to touch.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>But past who can recall, or don undoe?</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Not God omnipotent, for Fate, yet so</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Perhaps thou shalt not Die, perhaps the Fact</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Is not so hainous now, foretasted Fruit,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Profan’d first by the Serpent, by him first</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Made common and unhallowd: ere one tastes;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Nor yet on him found deadly; he yet lives,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Lives, as thou saidst, and gaines to live as Man</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Higher degree of Life, inducement strong</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To us, as likely tasting to attaine</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Proportional ascent, which cannot be</span>
						<br/>
						<span>But to be Gods, or Angels Demi-gods.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Nor can I think that God, Creator wise,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Though threatning, will in earnest so destroy</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Us his prime Creatures, dignifi’d so high,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Set over all his Works, which in our Fall,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>For us created, needs with us must faile,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Dependent made; so God shall uncreate,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Be frustrate, do, undo, and labour loose,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Not well conceav’d of God, who though his Power</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Creation could repeate, yet would be loath</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Us to abolish, least the Adversary</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Triumph and say; Fickle their State whom God</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Most Favors, who can please him long?  Mee first</span>
						<br/>
						<span>He ruind, now Mankind; whom will he next?</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Matter of scorne, not to be given the Foe.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>However I with thee have fixt my Lot,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Certain to undergoe like doom, if Death</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Consort with thee, Death is to mee as Life;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>So forcible within my heart I feel</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The Bond of Nature draw me to my owne,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>My own in thee, for what thou art is mine;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Our State cannot be severd, we are one,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>One Flesh; to loose thee were to loose my self.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>So <i>Adam</i>, and thus <i>Eve</i> to him repli’d.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>O glorious trial of exceeding Love,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Illustrious evidence, example high!</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Ingaging me to emulate, but short</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of thy perfection, how shall I attaine,</span>
						<br/>
						<span><i>Adam</i>, from whose deare side I boast me sprung,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And gladly of our Union heare thee speak,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>One Heart, one Soul in both; whereof good prooff</span>
						<br/>
						<span>This day affords, declaring thee resolvd,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Rather then Death or aught then Death more dread</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Shall separate us, linkt in Love so deare,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To undergoe with mee one Guilt, one Crime,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>If any be, of tasting this fair Fruit,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Whose vertue, for of good still good proceeds,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Direct, or by occasion hath presented</span>
						<br/>
						<span>This happie trial of thy Love, which else</span>
						<br/>
						<span>So eminently never had bin known.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Were it I thought Death menac’t would ensue</span>
						<br/>
						<span>This my attempt, I would sustain alone</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The worst, and not perswade thee, rather die</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Deserted, then oblige thee with a fact</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Pernicious to thy Peace, chiefly assur’d</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Remarkably so late of thy so true,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>So faithful Love unequald; but I feel</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Farr otherwise th’ event, not Death, but Life</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Augmented, op’nd Eyes, new Hopes, new Joyes,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Taste so Divine, that what of sweet before</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Hath toucht my sense, flat seems to this, and harsh.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>On my experience, <i>Adam</i>, freely taste,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And fear of Death deliver to the Windes.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>So saying, she embrac’d him, and for joy</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Tenderly wept, much won that he his Love</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Had so enobl’d, as of choice to incurr</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Divine displeasure for her sake, or Death.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>In recompence (for such compliance bad</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Such recompence best merits) from the bough</span>
						<br/>
						<span>She gave him of that fair enticing Fruit</span>
						<br/>
						<span>With liberal hand: he scrupl’d not to eat</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Against his better knowledge, not deceav’d,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>But fondly overcome with Femal charm.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Earth trembl’d from her entrails, as again</span>
						<br/>
						<span>In pangs, and Nature gave a second groan,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Skie lowr’d, and muttering Thunder, som sad drops</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Wept at compleating of the mortal Sin</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Original; while <i>Adam</i> took no thought,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Eating his fill, nor <i>Eve</i> to iterate</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Her former trespass fear’d, the more to soothe</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Him with her lov’d societie, that now</span>
						<br/>
						<span>As with new Wine intoxicated both</span>
						<br/>
						<span>They swim in mirth, and fansie that they feel</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Divinitie within them breeding wings</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Wherewith to scorn the Earth: but that false Fruit</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Farr other operation first displaid,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Carnal desire enflaming, hee on <i>Eve</i></span>
						<br/>
						<span>Began to cast lascivious Eyes, she him</span>
						<br/>
						<span>As wantonly repaid; in Lust they burne:</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Till <i>Adam</i> thus ’gan <i>Eve</i> to dalliance move.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span><i>Eve</i>, now I see thou art exact of taste,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And elegant, of Sapience no small part,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Since to each meaning savour we apply,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And Palate call judicious; I the praise</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Yeild thee, so well this day thou hast purvey’d.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Much pleasure we have lost, while we abstain’d</span>
						<br/>
						<span>From this delightful Fruit, nor known till now</span>
						<br/>
						<span>True relish, tasting; if such pleasure be</span>
						<br/>
						<span>In things to us forbidden, it might be wish’d,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>For this one Tree had bin forbidden ten.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>But come, so well refresh’t, now let us play,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>As meet is, after such delicious Fare;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>For never did thy Beautie since the day</span>
						<br/>
						<span>I saw thee first and wedded thee, adorn’d</span>
						<br/>
						<span>With all perfections, so enflame my sense</span>
						<br/>
						<span>With ardor to enjoy thee, fairer now</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Then ever, bountie of this vertuous Tree.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>So said he, and forbore not glance or toy</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of amorous intent, well understood</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of <i>Eve</i>, whose Eye darted contagious Fire.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Her hand he seis’d, and to a shadie bank,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Thick overhead with verdant roof imbowr’d</span>
						<br/>
						<span>He led her nothing loath; Flours were the Couch,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Pansies, and Violets, and Asphodel,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And Hyacinth, Earths freshest softest lap.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>There they thir fill of Love and Loves disport</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Took largely, of thir mutual guilt the Seale,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The solace of thir sin, till dewie sleep</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Oppress’d them, wearied with thir amorous play.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Soon as the force of that fallacious Fruit,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That with exhilerating vapour bland</span>
						<br/>
						<span>About thir spirits had plaid, and inmost powers</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Made erre, was now exhal’d, and grosser sleep</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Bred of unkindly fumes, with conscious dreams</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Encumberd, now had left them, up they rose</span>
						<br/>
						<span>As from unrest, and each the other viewing,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Soon found thir Eyes how op’nd, and thir minds</span>
						<br/>
						<span>How dark’nd; innocence, that as a veile</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Had shadow’d them from knowing ill, was gon,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Just confidence, and native righteousness,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And honour from about them, naked left</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To guiltie shame hee cover’d, but his Robe</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Uncover’d more.  So rose the <i>Danite</i> strong</span>
						<br/>
						<span><i>Herculean Samson</i> from the Harlot-lap</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of <i>Philistean Dalilah</i>, and wak’d</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Shorn of his strength, They destitute and bare</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of all thir vertue: silent, and in face</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Confounded long they sate, as struck’n mute,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Till <i>Adam</i>, though not less then <i>Eve</i> abasht,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>At length gave utterance to these words constraind.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>O <i>Eve</i>, in evil hour thou didst give care</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To that false Worm, of whomsoever taught</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To counterfet Mans voice, true in our Fall,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>False in our promis’d Rising; since our Eyes</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Op’nd we find indeed, and find we know</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Both Good and Evil, Good lost and Evil got,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Bad Fruit of Knowledge, if this be to know,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Which leaves us naked thus, of Honour void,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of Innocence, of Faith, of Puritie,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Our wonted Ornaments now soild and staind,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And in our Faces evident the signes</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of foul concupiscence; whence evil store;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Even shame, the last of evils; of the first</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Be sure then.  How shall I behold the face</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Henceforth of God or Angel, earst with joy</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And rapture so oft beheld? those heav’nly shapes</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Will dazle now this earthly, with thir blaze</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Insufferably bright.  O might I here</span>
						<br/>
						<span>In solitude live savage, in some glad</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Obscur’d, where highest Woods impenetrable</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To Starr or Sun-light, spread thir umbrage broad,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And brown as Evening: Cover me ye Pines,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Ye Cedars, with innumerable boughs</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Hide me, where I may never see them more.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>But let us now, as in bad plight, devise</span>
						<br/>
						<span>What best may for the present serve to hide</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The Parts of each from other, that seem most</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To shame obnoxious, and unseemliest seen,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Some Tree whose broad smooth Leaves together sowd,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And girded on our loyns, may cover round</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Those middle parts, that this new commer, Shame,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>There sit not, and reproach us as unclean.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>So counsel’d hee, and both together went</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Into the thickest Wood, there soon they chose</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The Figtree, not that kind for Fruit renown’d,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>But such as at this day to <i>Indians</i> known</span>
						<br/>
						<span>In <i>Malabar</i> or <i>Decan</i> spreds her Armes</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Braunching so broad and long, that in the ground</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The bended Twigs take root, and Daughters grow</span>
						<br/>
						<span>About the Mother Tree, a Pillard shade</span>
						<br/>
						<span>High overarch’t, and echoing Walks between;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>There oft the <i>Indian</i> Herdsman shunning heate</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Shelters in coole, and tends his pasturing Herds</span>
						<br/>
						<span>At Loopholes cut through thickest shade: Those Leaves</span>
						<br/>
						<span>They gatherd, broad as <i>Amazonian</i> Targe,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And with what skill they had, together sowd,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To gird thir waste, vain Covering if to hide</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Thir guilt and dreaded shame; O how unlike</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To that first naked Glorie.  Such of late</span>
						<br/>
						<span><i>Columbus</i> found th’ <i>American</i> to girt</span>
						<br/>
						<span>With featherd Cincture, naked else and wilde</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Among the Trees on Iles and woodie Shores.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Thus fenc’t, and as they thought, thir shame in part</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Coverd, but not at rest or ease of Mind,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>They sate them down to weep, nor onely Teares</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Raind at thir Eyes, but high Winds worse within</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Began to rise, high Passions, Anger, Hate,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Mistrust, Suspicion, Discord, and shook sore</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Thir inward State of Mind, calme Region once</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And full of Peace, now tost and turbulent:</span>
						<br/>
						<span>For Understanding rul’d not, and the Will</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Heard not her lore, both in subjection now</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To sensual Appetite, who from beneathe</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Usurping over sovran Reason claimd</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Superior sway: From thus distemperd brest,</span>
						<br/>
						<span><i>Adam</i>, estrang’d in look and alterd stile,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Speech intermitted thus to <i>Eve</i> renewd.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>Would thou hadst heark’nd to my words, &amp; stai’d</span>
						<br/>
						<span>With me, as I besought thee, when that strange</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Desire of wandring this unhappie Morn,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>I know not whence possessd thee; we had then</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Remaind still happie, not as now, despoild</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of all our good, sham’d, naked, miserable.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Let none henceforth seek needless cause to approve</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The Faith they owe; when earnestly they seek</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Such proof, conclude, they then begin to faile.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>To whom soon mov’d with touch of blame thus <i>Eve</i>.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>What words have past thy Lips, <i>Adam</i> severe,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Imput’st thou that to my default, or will</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of wandering, as thou call’st it, which who knows</span>
						<br/>
						<span>But might as ill have happ’nd thou being by,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Or to thy self perhaps: hadst thou bin there,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Or bere th’ attempt, thou couldst not have discernd</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Fraud in the Serpent, speaking as he spake;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>No ground of enmitie between us known,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Why hee should mean me ill, or seek to harme.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Was I to have never parted from thy side?</span>
						<br/>
						<span>As good have grown there still a liveless Rib.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Being as I am, why didst not thou the Head</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Command me absolutely not to go,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Going into such danger as thou saidst?</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Too facil then thou didst not much gainsay,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Nay, didst permit, approve, and fair dismiss.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Hadst thou bin firm and fixt in thy dissent,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Neither had I transgress’d, nor thou with mee.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>To whom then first incenst <i>Adam</i> repli’d.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Is this the Love, is the recompence</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of mine to thee, ingrateful <i>Eve</i>, exprest</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Immutable when thou wert lost, not I,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Who might have liv’d and joyd immortal bliss,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Yet willingly chose rather Death with thee:</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And am I now upbraided, as the cause</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of thy transgressing? not enough severe,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>It seems, in thy restraint: what could I more?</span>
						<br/>
						<span>I warn’d thee, I admonish’d thee, foretold</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The danger, and the lurking Enemie</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That lay in wait; beyond this had bin force,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And force upon free Will hath here no place.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>But confidence then bore thee on, secure</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Either to meet no danger, or to finde</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Matter of glorious trial; and perhaps</span>
						<br/>
						<span>I also err’d in overmuch admiring</span>
						<br/>
						<span>What seemd in thee so perfet, that I thought</span>
						<br/>
						<span>No evil durst attempt thee, but I rue</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That errour now, which is become my crime,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And thou th’ accuser.  Thus it shall befall</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Him who to worth in Women overtrusting</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Lets her Will rule; restraint she will not brook,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And left to her self, if evil thence ensue,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Shee first his weak indulgence will accuse.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>Thus they in mutual accusation spent</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The fruitless hours, but neither self-condemning</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And of thir vain contest appeer’d no end.</span>
