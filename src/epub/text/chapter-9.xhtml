<p class="pfirst">
Meanwhile the hainous and despightfull act<br/>
Of <i>Satan</i> done in Paradise, and how<br/>
Hee in the Serpent had perverted <i>Eve</i>,<br/>
Her Husband shee, to taste the fatall fruit,<br/>
Was known in Heav’n; for what can scape the Eye<br/>
Of God All-seeing, or deceave his Heart<br/>
Omniscient, who in all things wise and just,<br/>
Hinder’d not <i>Satan</i> to attempt the minde<br/>
Of Man, with strength entire, and free Will arm’d,<br/>
Complete to have discover’d and repulst<br/>
Whatever wiles of Foe or seeming Friend.<br/>
For still they knew, and ought to have still remember’d<br/>
The high Injunction not to taste that Fruit,<br/>
Whoever tempted; which they not obeying,<br/>
Incurr’d, what could they less, the penaltie,<br/>
And manifold in sin, deserv’d to fall.<br/>
Up into Heav’n from Paradise in hast<br/>
Th’ Angelic Guards ascended, mute and sad<br/>
For Man, for of his state by this they knew,<br/>
Much wondring how the suttle Fiend had stoln<br/>
Entrance unseen.  Soon as th’ unwelcome news<br/>
From Earth arriv’d at Heaven Gate, displeas’d<br/>
All were who heard, dim sadness did not spare<br/>
That time Celestial visages, yet mixt<br/>
With pitie, violated not thir bliss.<br/>
About the new-arriv’d, in multitudes<br/>
Th’ ethereal People ran, to hear and know<br/>
How all befell: they towards the Throne Supream<br/>
Accountable made haste to make appear<br/>
With righteous plea, thir utmost vigilance,<br/>
And easily approv’d; when the most High<br/>
Eternal Father from his secret Cloud,<br/>
Amidst in Thunder utter’d thus his voice.<br/>
</p>
<p class="poem">
Assembl’d Angels, and ye Powers return’d<br/>
From unsuccessful charge, be not dismaid,<br/>
Nor troubl’d at these tidings from the Earth,<br/>
Which your sincerest care could not prevent,<br/>
Foretold so lately what would come to pass,<br/>
When first this Tempter cross’d the Gulf from Hell.<br/>
I told ye then he should prevail and speed<br/>
On his bad Errand, Man should be seduc’t<br/>
And flatter’d out of all, believing lies<br/>
Against his Maker; no Decree of mine<br/>
Concurring to necessitate his Fall,<br/>
Or touch with lightest moment of impulse<br/>
His free Will, to her own inclining left<br/>
In eevn scale.  But fall’n he is, and now<br/>
What rests, but that the mortal Sentence pass<br/>
On his transgression, Death denounc’t that day,<br/>
Which he presumes already vain and void,<br/>
Because not yet inflicted, as he fear’d,<br/>
By some immediate stroak; but soon shall find<br/>
Forbearance no acquittance ere day end.<br/>
Justice shall not return as bountie scorn’d.<br/>
But whom send I to judge them? whom but thee<br/>
Vicegerent Son, to thee I have transferr’d<br/>
All Judgement, whether in Heav’n, or Earth; or Hell.<br/>
Easie it may be seen that I intend<br/>
Mercie collegue with Justice, sending thee<br/>
Mans Friend, his Mediator, his design’d<br/>
Both Ransom and Redeemer voluntarie,<br/>
And destin’d Man himself to judge Man fall’n.<br/>
</p>
<p class="poem">
So spake the Father, and unfoulding bright<br/>
Toward the right hand his Glorie, on the Son<br/>
Blaz’d forth unclouded Deitie; he full<br/>
Resplendent all his Father manifest<br/>
Express’d, and thus divinely answer’d milde.<br/>
</p>
<p class="poem">
Father Eternal, thine is to decree,<br/>
Mine both in Heav’n and Earth to do thy will<br/>
Supream, that thou in mee thy Son belov’d<br/>
Mayst ever rest well pleas’d.  I go to judge<br/>
On Earth these thy transgressors, but thou knowst,<br/>
Whoever judg’d, the worst on mee must light,<br/>
When time shall be, for so I undertook<br/>
Before thee; and not repenting, this obtaine<br/>
Of right, that I may mitigate thir doom<br/>
On me deriv’d, yet I shall temper so<br/>
Justice with Mercie, as may illustrate most<br/>
Them fully satisfied, and thee appease.<br/>
Attendance none shall need, nor Train, where none<br/>
Are to behold the Judgement, but the judg’d,<br/>
Those two; the third best absent is condemn’d,<br/>
Convict by flight, and Rebel to all Law<br/>
Conviction to the Serpent none belongs.<br/>
</p>
<p class="poem">
Thus saying, from his radiant Seat he rose<br/>
Of high collateral glorie: him Thrones and Powers,<br/>
Princedoms, and Dominations ministrant<br/>
Accompanied to Heaven Gate, from whence<br/>
<i>Eden</i> and all the Coast in prospect lay.<br/>
Down he descended strait; the speed of Gods<br/>
Time counts not, though with swiftest minutes wing’d.<br/>
Now was the Sun in Western cadence low<br/>
From Noon, and gentle Aires due at thir hour<br/>
To fan the Earth now wak’d, and usher in<br/>
The Eevning coole when he from wrauth more coole<br/>
Came the mild Judge and Intercessor both<br/>
To sentence Man: the voice of God they heard<br/>
Now walking in the Garden, by soft windes<br/>
Brought to thir Ears, while day declin’d, they heard<br/>
And from his presence hid themselves among<br/>
The thickest Trees, both Man and Wife, till God<br/>
Approaching, thus to <i>Adam</i> call’d aloud.<br/>
</p>
<p class="poem">
Where art thou <i>Adam</i>, wont with joy to meet<br/>
My coming seen far off?  I miss thee here,<br/>
Not pleas’d, thus entertaind with solitude,<br/>
Where obvious dutie erewhile appear’d unsaught:<br/>
Or come I less conspicuous, or what change<br/>
Absents thee, or what chance detains?  Come forth.<br/>
He came, and with him <i>Eve</i>, more loth, though first<br/>
To offend, discount’nanc’t both, and discompos’d;<br/>
Love was not in thir looks, either to God<br/>
Or to each other, but apparent guilt,<br/>
And shame, and perturbation, and despaire,<br/>
Anger, and obstinacie, and hate, and guile.<br/>
Whence <i>Adam</i> faultring long, thus answer’d brief.<br/>
</p>
<p class="poem">
I heard thee in the Garden, and of thy voice<br/>
Affraid, being naked, hid my self.  To whom<br/>
The gracious Judge without revile repli’d.<br/>
</p>
<p class="poem">
My voice thou oft hast heard, and hast not fear’d,<br/>
But still rejoyc’t, how is it now become<br/>
So dreadful to thee? that thou art naked, who<br/>
Hath told thee? hast thou eaten of the Tree<br/>
Whereof I gave thee charge thou shouldst not eat?<br/>
</p>
<p class="poem">
To whom thus <i>Adam</i> sore beset repli’d.<br/>
O Heav’n! in evil strait this day I stand<br/>
Before my Judge, either to undergoe<br/>
My self the total Crime, or to accuse<br/>
My other self, the partner of my life;<br/>
Whose failing, while her Faith to me remaines,<br/>
I should conceal, and not expose to blame<br/>
By my complaint; but strict necessitie<br/>
Subdues me, and calamitous constraint,<br/>
Least on my head both sin and punishment,<br/>
However insupportable, be all<br/>
Devolv’d; though should I hold my peace, yet thou<br/>
Wouldst easily detect what I conceale.<br/>
This Woman whom thou mad’st to be my help,<br/>
And gav’st me as thy perfet gift, so good,<br/>
So fit, so acceptable, so Divine,<br/>
That from her hand I could suspect no ill,<br/>
And what she did, whatever in it self,<br/>
Her doing seem’d to justifie the deed;<br/>
Shee gave me of the Tree, and I did eate.<br/>
</p>
<p class="poem">
To whom the sovran Presence thus repli’d.<br/>
Was shee thy God, that her thou didst obey<br/>
Before his voice, or was shee made thy guide,<br/>
Superior, or but equal, that to her<br/>
Thou did’st resigne thy Manhood, and the Place<br/>
Wherein God set thee above her made of thee,<br/>
And for thee, whose perfection farr excell’d<br/>
Hers in all real dignitie: Adornd<br/>
She was indeed, and lovely to attract<br/>
Thy Love, not thy Subjection, and her Gifts<br/>
Were such as under Government well seem’d,<br/>
Unseemly to beare rule, which was thy part<br/>
And person, had’st thou known thy self aright.<br/>
</p>
<p class="poem">
So having said, he thus to <i>Eve</i> in few:<br/>
Say Woman, what is this which thou hast done?<br/>
</p>
<p class="poem">
To whom sad <i>Eve</i> with shame nigh overwhelm’d,<br/>
Confessing soon, yet not before her Judge<br/>
Bold or loquacious, thus abasht repli’d.<br/>
</p>
<p class="poem">
The Serpent me beguil’d and I did eate.</p>
<p class="poem">
Which when the Lord God heard, without delay<br/>
To Judgement he proceeded on th’ accus’d<br/>
Serpent though brute, unable to transferre<br/>
The Guilt on him who made him instrument<br/>
Of mischief, and polluted from the end<br/>
Of his Creation; justly then accurst,<br/>
As vitiated in Nature: more to know<br/>
Concern’d not Man (since he no further knew)<br/>
Nor alter’d his offence; yet God at last<br/>
To Satan first in sin his doom apply’d,<br/>
Though in mysterious terms, judg’d as then best:<br/>
And on the Serpent thus his curse let fall.<br/>
</p>
<p class="poem">
Because thou hast done this, thou art accurst<br/>
Above all Cattel, each Beast of the Field;<br/>
Upon thy Belly groveling thou shalt goe,<br/>
And dust shalt eat all the days of thy Life.<br/>
Between Thee and the Woman I will put<br/>
Enmitie, and between thine and her Seed;<br/>
Her Seed shall bruise thy head, thou bruise his heel.<br/>
</p>
<p class="poem">
So spake this Oracle, then verifi’d<br/>
When <i>Jesus</i> son of <i>Mary</i> second <i>Eve</i>,<br/>
Saw Satan fall like Lightning down from Heav’n,<br/>
Prince of the Aire; then rising from his Grave<br/>
Spoild Principalities and Powers, triumpht<br/>
In open shew, and with ascention bright<br/>
Captivity led captive through the Aire,<br/>
The Realme it self of Satan long usurpt,<br/>
Whom he shall tread at last under our feet;<br/>
Eevn hee who now foretold his fatal bruise,<br/>
And to the Woman thus his Sentence turn’d.<br/>
</p>
<p class="poem">
Thy sorrow I will greatly multiplie<br/>
By thy Conception; Children thou shalt bring<br/>
In sorrow forth, and to thy Husbands will<br/>
Thine shall submit, hee over thee shall rule.<br/>
</p>
<p class="poem">
On <i>Adam</i> last thus judgement he pronounc’d.<br/>
Because thou hast heark’nd to the voice of thy Wife,<br/>
And eaten of the Tree concerning which<br/>
I charg’d thee, saying: Thou shalt not eate thereof,<br/>
Curs’d is the ground for thy sake, thou in sorrow<br/>
Shalt eate thereof all the days of thy Life;<br/>
Thornes also and Thistles it shall bring thee forth<br/>
Unbid, and thou shalt eate th’ Herb of th’ Field,<br/>
In the sweat of thy Face shalt thou eate Bread,<br/>
Till thou return unto the ground, for thou<br/>
Out of the ground wast taken, know thy Birth,<br/>
For dust thou art, and shalt to dust returne.<br/>
</p>
<p class="poem">
 So judg’d he Man, both Judge and Saviour sent,<br/>
And th’ instant stroke of Death denounc’t that day<br/>
Remov’d farr off; then pittying how they stood<br/>
Before him naked to the aire, that now<br/>
Must suffer change, disdain’d not to begin<br/>
Thenceforth the forme of servant to assume,<br/>
As when he wash’d his servants feet, so now<br/>
As Father of his Familie he clad<br/>
Thir nakedness with Skins of Beasts, or slain,<br/>
Or as the Snake with youthful Coate repaid;<br/>
And thought not much to cloath his Enemies:<br/>
Nor hee thir outward onely with the Skins<br/>
Of Beasts, but inward nakedness, much more<br/>
Opprobrious, with his Robe of righteousness,<br/>
Araying cover’d from his Fathers sight.<br/>
To him with swift ascent he up returnd,<br/>
Into his blissful bosom reassum’d<br/>
In glory as of old, to him appeas’d<br/>
All, though all-knowing, what had past with Man<br/>
Recounted, mixing intercession sweet.<br/>
Meanwhile ere thus was sin’d and judg’d on Earth,<br/>
Within the Gates of Hell sate Sin and Death,<br/>
In counterview within the Gates, that now<br/>
Stood open wide, belching outrageous flame<br/>
Farr into <i>Chaos</i>, since the Fiend pass’d through,<br/>
Sin opening, who thus now to Death began.<br/>
</p>
<p class="poem">
O Son, why sit we here each other viewing<br/>
Idlely, while Satan our great Author thrives<br/>
In other Worlds, and happier Seat provides<br/>
For us his ofspring deare?  It cannot be<br/>
But that success attends him; if mishap,<br/>
Ere this he had return’d, with fury driv’n<br/>
By his Avenger, since no place like this<br/>
Can fit his punishment, or their revenge.<br/>
Methinks I feel new strength within me rise,<br/>
Wings growing, and Dominion giv’n me large<br/>
Beyond this Deep; whatever drawes me on,<br/>
Or sympathie, or som connatural force<br/>
Powerful at greatest distance to unite<br/>
With secret amity things of like kinde<br/>
By secretest conveyance.  Thou my Shade<br/>
Inseparable must with mee along:<br/>
For Death from Sin no power can separate.<br/>
But least the difficultie of passing back<br/>
Stay his returne perhaps over this Gulfe<br/>
Impassable, impervious, let us try<br/>
Adventrous work, yet to thy power and mine<br/>
Not unagreeable, to found a path<br/>
Over this Maine from Hell to that new World<br/>
Where Satan now prevailes, a Monument<br/>
Of merit high to all th’ infernal Host,<br/>
Easing thir passage hence, for intercourse,<br/>
Or transmigration, as thir lot shall lead.<br/>
Nor can I miss the way, so strongly drawn<br/>
By this new felt attraction and instinct.<br/>
</p>
<p class="poem">
Whom thus the meager Shadow answerd soon.<br/>
Goe whither Fate and inclination strong<br/>
Leads thee, I shall not lag behinde, nor erre<br/>
The way, thou leading, such a sent I draw<br/>
Of carnage, prey innumerable, and taste<br/>
The savour of Death from all things there that live:<br/>
Nor shall I to the work thou enterprisest<br/>
Be wanting, but afford thee equal aid.<br/>
</p>
<p class="poem">
So saying, with delight he snuff’d the smell<br/>
Of mortal change on Earth.  As when a flock<br/>
Of ravenous Fowl, though many a League remote,<br/>
Against the day of Battel, to a Field,<br/>
Where Armies lie encampt, come flying, lur’d<br/>
With sent of living Carcasses design’d<br/>
For death, the following day, in bloodie fight.<br/>
So sented the grim Feature, and upturn’d<br/>
His Nostril wide into the murkie Air,<br/>
Sagacious of his Quarrey from so farr.<br/>
Then Both from out Hell Gates into the waste<br/>
Wide Anarchie of <i>Chaos</i> damp and dark<br/>
Flew divers, &amp; with Power (thir Power was great)<br/>
Hovering upon the Waters; what they met<br/>
Solid or slimie, as in raging Sea<br/>
Tost up and down, together crowded drove<br/>
From each side shoaling towards the mouth of Hell.<br/>
As when two Polar Winds blowing adverse<br/>
Upon the <i>Cronian</i> Sea, together drive<br/>
Mountains of Ice, that stop th’ imagin’d way<br/>
Beyond <i>Petsora</i> Eastward, to the rich<br/>
<i>Cathaian</i> Coast.  The aggregated Soyle<br/>
Death with his Mace petrific, cold and dry,<br/>
As with a Trident smote, and fix’t as firm<br/>
As <i>Delos</i> floating once; the rest his look<br/>
Bound with <i>Gorgonian</i> rigor not to move,<br/>
And with <i>Asphaltic</i> slime; broad as the Gate,<br/>
Deep to the Roots of Hell the gather’d beach<br/>
They fasten’d, and the Mole immense wraught on<br/>
Over the foaming deep high Archt, a Bridge<br/>
Of length prodigious joyning to the Wall<br/>
Immoveable of this now fenceless world<br/>
Forfeit to Death; from hence a passage broad,<br/>
Smooth, easie, inoffensive down to Hell.<br/>
So, if great things to small may be compar’d,<br/>
<i>Xerxes</i>, the Libertie of <i>Greece</i> to yoke,<br/>
From <i>Susa</i> his <i>Memnonian</i> Palace high<br/>
Came to the Sea, and over <i>Hellespont</i><br/>
Bridging his way, <i>Europe</i> with <i>Asia</i> joyn’d,<br/>
And scourg’d with many a stroak th’ indignant waves.<br/>
Now had they brought the work by wondrous Art<br/>
Pontifical, a ridge of pendent Rock<br/>
Over the vext Abyss, following the track<br/>
Of <i>Satan</i>, to the selfsame place where hee<br/>
First lighted from his Wing, and landed safe<br/>
From out of <i>Chaos</i> to the outside bare<br/>
Of this round World: with Pinns of Adamant<br/>
And Chains they made all fast, too fast they made<br/>
And durable; and now in little space<br/>
The Confines met of Empyrean Heav’n<br/>
And of this World, and on the left hand Hell<br/>
With long reach interpos’d; three sev’ral wayes<br/>
In sight, to each of these three places led.<br/>
And now thir way to Earth they had descri’d,<br/>
To Paradise first tending, when behold<br/>
<i>Satan</i> in likeness of an Angel bright<br/>
Betwixt the <i>Centaure</i> and the <i>Scorpion</i> stearing<br/>
His <i>Zenith</i>, while the Sun in <i>Aries</i> rose:<br/>
Disguis’d he came, but those his Children dear<br/>
Thir Parent soon discern’d, though in disguise.<br/>
Hee, after <i>Eve</i> seduc’t, unminded slunk<br/>
Into the Wood fast by, and changing shape<br/>
To observe the sequel, saw his guileful act<br/>
By <i>Eve</i>, though all unweeting, seconded<br/>
Upon her Husband, saw thir shame that sought<br/>
Vain covertures; but when he saw descend<br/>
The Son of God to judge them, terrifi’d<br/>
Hee fled, not hoping to escape, but shun<br/>
The present, fearing guiltie what his wrauth<br/>
Might suddenly inflict; that past, return’d<br/>
By Night, and listning where the hapless Paire<br/>
Sate in thir sad discourse, and various plaint,<br/>
Thence gatherd his own doom, which understood<br/>
Not instant, but of future time.  With joy<br/>
And tidings fraught, to Hell he now return’d,<br/>
And at the brink of <i>Chaos</i>, neer the foot<br/>
Of this new wondrous Pontifice, unhop’t<br/>
Met who to meet him came, his Ofspring dear.<br/>
Great joy was at thir meeting, and at sight<br/>
Of that stupendious Bridge his joy encreas’d.<br/>
Long hee admiring stood, till Sin, his faire<br/>
Inchanting Daughter, thus the silence broke.<br/>
</p>
<p class="poem">
O Parent, these are thy magnific deeds,<br/>
Thy Trophies, which thou view’st as not thine own,<br/>
Thou art thir Author and prime Architect:<br/>
For I no sooner in my Heart divin’d,<br/>
My Heart, which by a secret harmonie<br/>
Still moves with thine, joyn’d in connexion sweet,<br/>
That thou on Earth hadst prosper’d, which thy looks<br/>
Now also evidence, but straight I felt<br/>
Though distant from thee Worlds between, yet felt<br/>
That I must after thee with this thy Son;<br/>
Such fatal consequence unites us three:<br/>
Hell could no longer hold us in her bounds,<br/>
Nor this unvoyageable Gulf obscure<br/>
Detain from following thy illustrious track.<br/>
Thou hast atchiev’d our libertie, confin’d<br/>
Within Hell Gates till now, thou us impow’rd<br/>
To fortifie thus farr, and overlay<br/>
With this portentous Bridge the dark Abyss.<br/>
Thine now is all this World, thy vertue hath won<br/>
What thy hands builded not, thy Wisdom gain’d<br/>
With odds what Warr hath lost, and fully aveng’d<br/>
Our foile in Heav’n; here thou shalt Monarch reign,<br/>
There didst not; there let him still Victor sway,<br/>
As Battel hath adjudg’d, from this new World<br/>
Retiring, by his own doom alienated,<br/>
And henceforth Monarchie with thee divide<br/>
Of all things, parted by th’ Empyreal bounds,<br/>

Triumphal with triumphal act have met,<br/>

So saying he dismiss’d them, they with speed<br/>
Thir course through thickest Constellations held<br/>
Spreading thir bane; the blasted Starrs lookt wan,<br/>
And Planets, Planet-strook, real Eclips<br/>
Then sufferd.  Th’ other way <i>Satan</i> went down<br/>
The Causey to Hell Gate; on either side<br/>
Disparted <i>Chaos</i> over built exclaimd,<br/>
And with rebounding surge the barrs assaild,<br/>
That scorn’d his indignation: through the Gate,<br/>
Wide open and unguarded, <i>Satan</i> pass’d,<br/>
And all about found desolate; for those<br/>
Appointed to sit there, had left thir charge,<br/>
Flown to the upper World; the rest were all<br/>
Farr to the inland retir’d, about the walls<br/>
Of <i>Pandemonium</i>, Citie and proud seate<br/>
Of <i>Lucifer</i>, so by allusion calld,<br/>
Of that bright Starr to <i>Satan</i> paragond.<br/>
There kept thir Watch the Legions, while the Grand<br/>
In Council sate, sollicitous what chance<br/>
Might intercept thir Emperour sent, so hee<br/>

As when the <i>Tartar</i> from his <i>Russian</i> Foe<br/>
By <i>Astracan</i> over the Snowie Plaines<br/>
Retires, or <i>Bactrian</i> Sophi from the hornes<br/>
Of <i>Turkish</i> Crescent, leaves all waste beyond<br/>
The Realme of <i>Aladule</i>, in his retreate<br/>
To <i>Tauris</i> or <i>Casbeen</i>.  So these the late<br/>
Heav’n-banisht Host, left desert utmost Hell<br/>
Many a dark League, reduc’t in careful Watch<br/>
Round thir Metropolis, and now expecting<br/>
Each hour their great adventurer from the search<br/>
Of Forrein Worlds: he through the midst unmarkt,<br/>
In shew plebeian Angel militant<br/>
Of lowest order, past; and from the dore<br/>
Of that <i>Plutonian</i> Hall, invisible<br/>
Ascended his high Throne, which under state<br/>
Of richest texture spred, at th’ upper end<br/>
Was plac’t in regal lustre.  Down a while<br/>
He sate, and round about him saw unseen:<br/>
At last as from a Cloud his fulgent head<br/>

With what permissive glory since his fall<br/>

Forth rush’d in haste the great consulting Peers,<br/>
Rais’d from thir dark <i>Divan</i>, and with like joy<br/>
Congratulant approach’d him, who with hand<br/>

Thrones, Dominations, Princedoms, Vertues, Powers,<br/>
For in possession such, not onely of right,<br/>

True is, mee also he hath judg’d, or rather<br/>
Mee not, but the brute Serpent in whose shape<br/>
Man I deceav’d: that which to mee belongs,<br/>
Is enmity, which he will put between<br/>
Mee and Mankinde; I am to bruise his heel;<br/>
His Seed, when is not set, shall bruise my head:<br/>
A World who would not purchase with a bruise,<br/>
Or much more grievous pain?  Ye have th’ account<br/>
Of my performance: What remaines, ye Gods,<br/>
But up and enter now into full bliss.<br/>
</p>
<p class="poem">
So having said, a while he stood, expecting<br/>
Thir universal shout and high applause<br/>
To fill his eare, when contrary he hears<br/>
On all sides, from innumerable tongues<br/>
A dismal universal hiss, the sound<br/>
Of public scorn; he wonderd, but not long<br/>
Had leasure, wondring at himself now more;<br/>
His Visage drawn he felt to sharp and spare,<br/>
His Armes clung to his Ribs, his Leggs entwining<br/>
Each other, till supplanted down he fell<br/>
A monstrous Serpent on his Belly prone,<br/>
Reluctant, but in vaine, a greater power<br/>
Now rul’d him, punisht in the shape he sin’d,<br/>
According to his doom: he would have spoke,<br/>
But hiss for hiss returnd with forked tongue<br/>
To forked tongue, for now were all transform’d<br/>
Alike, to Serpents all as accessories<br/>
To his bold Riot: dreadful was the din<br/>
Of hissing through the Hall, thick swarming now<br/>
With complicated monsters, head and taile,<br/>
Scorpion and Asp, and <i>Amphisbaena</i> dire,<br/>
<i>Cerastes</i> hornd, <i>Hydrus</i>, and <i>Ellops</i> drear,<br/>
And <i>Dipsas</i> (Not so thick swarm’d once the Soil<br/>
Bedropt with blood of Gorgon, or the Isle<br/>
<i>Ophiusa</i>) but still greatest hee the midst,<br/>
Now Dragon grown, larger then whom the Sun<br/>
Ingenderd in the <i>Pythian</i> Vale on slime,<br/>
Huge <i>Python</i>, and his Power no less he seem’d<br/>
Above the rest still to retain; they all<br/>
Him follow’d issuing forth to th’ open Field,<br/>
Where all yet left of that revolted Rout<br/>
Heav’n-fall’n, in station stood or just array,<br/>
Sublime with expectation when to see<br/>
In Triumph issuing forth thir glorious Chief;<br/>
They saw, but other sight instead, a crowd<br/>
Of ugly Serpents; horror on them fell,<br/>
And horrid sympathie; for what they saw,<br/>
They felt themselvs now changing; down thir arms,<br/>
Down fell both Spear and Shield, down they as fast,<br/>
And the dire hiss renew’d, and the dire form<br/>
Catcht by Contagion, like in punishment,<br/>
As in thir crime.  Thus was th’ applause they meant,<br/>
Turnd to exploding hiss, triumph to shame<br/>
Cast on themselves from thir own mouths.  There stood<br/>
A Grove hard by, sprung up with this thir change,<br/>
His will who reigns above, to aggravate<br/>
Thir penance, laden with fair Fruit, like that<br/>
VVhich grew in Paradise, the bait of <i>Eve</i><br/>
Us’d by the Tempter: on that prospect strange<br/>
Thir earnest eyes they fix’d, imagining<br/>
For one forbidden Tree a multitude<br/>
Now ris’n, to work them furder woe or shame;<br/>
Yet parcht with scalding thurst and hunger fierce,<br/>
Though to delude them sent, could not abstain,<br/>
But on they rould in heaps, and up the Trees<br/>
Climbing, sat thicker then the snakie locks<br/>
That curld <i>Megaera</i>: greedily they pluck’d<br/>
The Frutage fair to sight, like that which grew<br/>
Neer that bituminous Lake where <i>Sodom</i> flam’d;<br/>
This more delusive, not the touch, but taste<br/>
Deceav’d; they fondly thinking to allay<br/>
Thir appetite with gust, instead of Fruit<br/>
Chewd bitter Ashes, which th’ offended taste<br/>
VVith spattering noise rejected: oft they assayd,<br/>
Hunger and thirst constraining, drugd as oft,<br/>
VVith hatefullest disrelish writh’d thir jaws<br/>
VVith foot and cinders fill’d; so oft they fell<br/>
Into the same illusion, not as Man<br/>
Whom they triumph’d once lapst.  Thus were they plagu’d<br/>
And worn with Famin, long and ceasless hiss,<br/>
Till thir lost shape, permitted, they resum’d,<br/>
Yearly enjoynd, some say, to undergo<br/>
This annual humbling certain number’d days,<br/>
To dash thir pride, and joy for Man seduc’t.<br/>
However some tradition they dispers’d<br/>
Among the Heathen of thir purchase got,<br/>
And Fabl’d how the Serpent, whom they calld<br/>
<i>Ophion</i> with <i>Eurynome</i>, the wide-<br/>
Encroaching <i>Eve</i> perhaps, had first the rule<br/>
Of high <i>Olympus</i>, thence by <i>Saturn</i> driv’n<br/>
And <i>Ops</i>, ere yet <i>Dictaean</i> <i>Jove</i> was born.<br/>
Mean while in Paradise the hellish pair<br/>
Too soon arriv’d, <i>Sin</i> there in power before,<br/>
Once actual, now in body, and to dwell<br/>
Habitual habitant; behind her <i>Death</i><br/>
Close following pace for pace, not mounted yet<br/>
On his pale Horse: to whom <i>Sin</i> thus began.<br/>
</p>
<p class="poem">
Second of <i>Satan</i> sprung, all conquering Death,<br/>
What thinkst thou of our Empire now, though earnd<br/>
With travail difficult, not better farr<br/>

Whom thus the Sin-born Monster answerd soon.<br/>
To mee, who with eternal Famin pine,<br/>
Alike is Hell, or Paradise, or Heaven,<br/>

This said, they both betook them several wayes,<br/>
Both to destroy, or unimmortal make<br/>

See with what heat these Dogs of Hell advance<br/>
To waste and havoc yonder VVorld, which I<br/>
So fair and good created, and had still<br/>
Kept in that state, had not the folly of Man<br/>

Folly to mee, so doth the Prince of Hell<br/>
And his Adherents, that with so much ease<br/>
I suffer them to enter and possess<br/>
A place so heav’nly, and conniving seem<br/>
To gratifie my scornful Enemies,<br/>
That laugh, as if transported with some fit<br/>
Of Passion, I to them had quitted all,<br/>
At random yeilded up to their misrule;<br/>
And know not that I call’d and drew them thither<br/>
My Hell-hounds, to lick up the draff and filth<br/>
Which mans polluting Sin with taint hath shed<br/>
On what was pure, till cramm’d and gorg’d, nigh burst<br/>
With suckt and glutted offal, at one fling<br/>
Of thy victorious Arm, well-pleasing Son,<br/>
Both <i>Sin</i>, and <i>Death</i>, and yawning <i>Grave</i> at last<br/>
Through <i>Chaos</i> hurld, obstruct the mouth of Hell<br/>

Righteous are thy Decrees on all thy Works;<br/>
Who can extenuate thee?  Next, to the Son,<br/>
Destin’d restorer of Mankind, by whom<br/>
New Heav’n and Earth shall to the Ages rise,<br/>
Or down from Heav’n descend.  Such was thir song,<br/>
While the Creator calling forth by name<br/>
His mightie Angels gave them several charge,<br/>
As sorted best with present things.  The Sun<br/>
Had first his precept so to move, so shine,<br/>
As might affect the Earth with cold and heat<br/>
Scarce tollerable, and from the North to call<br/>
Decrepit Winter, from the South to bring<br/>
Solstitial summers heat.  To the blanc Moone<br/>
Her office they prescrib’d, to th’ other five<br/>
Thir planetarie motions and aspects<br/>
In <i>Sextile</i>, <i>Square</i>, and <i>Trine</i>, and <i>Opposite</i>,<br/>
Of noxious efficacie, and when to joyne<br/>
In Synod unbenigne, and taught the fixt<br/>
Thir influence malignant when to showre,<br/>
Which of them rising with the Sun, or falling,<br/>
Should prove tempestuous: To the Winds they set<br/>
Thir corners, when with bluster to confound<br/>
Sea, Aire, and Shoar, the Thunder when to rowle<br/>
With terror through the dark Aereal Hall.<br/>
Some say he bid his Angels turne ascanse<br/>
The Poles of Earth twice ten degrees and more<br/>
From the Suns Axle; they with labour push’d<br/>
Oblique the Centric Globe: Som say the Sun<br/>
Was bid turn Reines from th’ Equinoctial Rode<br/>
Like distant breadth to <i>Taurus</i> with the Seav’n<br/>
<i>Atlantick</i> Sisters, and the <i>Spartan</i> Twins<br/>
Up to the <i>Tropic</i> Crab; thence down amaine<br/>
By <i>Leo</i> and the <i>Virgin</i> and the <i>Scales</i>,<br/>
As deep as <i>Capricorne</i>, to bring in change<br/>
Of Seasons to each Clime; else had the Spring<br/>
Perpetual smil’d on Earth with vernant Flours,<br/>
Equal in Days and Nights, except to those<br/>
Beyond the Polar Circles; to them Day<br/>
Had unbenighted shon, while the low Sun<br/>
To recompence his distance, in thir sight<br/>
Had rounded still th’ <i>Horizon</i>, and not known<br/>
Or East or West, which had forbid the Snow<br/>
From cold <i>Estotiland</i>, and South as farr<br/>
Beneath <i>Magellan</i>.  At that tasted Fruit<br/>
The Sun, as from <i>Thyestean</i> Banquet, turn’d<br/>
His course intended; else how had the World<br/>
Inhabited, though sinless, more then now,<br/>
Avoided pinching cold and scorching heate?<br/>
These changes in the Heav’ns, though slow, produc’d<br/>
Like change on Sea and Land, sideral blast,<br/>
Vapour, and Mist, and Exhalation hot,<br/>
Corrupt and Pestilent: Now from the North<br/>
Of <i>Norumbega</i>, and the <i>Samoed</i> shoar<br/>
Bursting thir brazen Dungeon, armd with ice<br/>
And snow and haile and stormie gust and flaw,<br/>
<i>Boreas</i> and <i>Caecias</i> and <i>Argestes</i> loud<br/>
And <i>Thrascias</i> rend the Woods and Seas upturn;<br/>
With adverse blast up-turns them from the South<br/>
<i>Notus</i> and <i>Afer</i> black with thundrous Clouds<br/>
From <i>Serraliona</i>; thwart of these as fierce<br/>
Forth rush the <i>Levant</i> and the <i>Ponent</i> VVindes<br/>
<i>Eurus</i> and <i>Zephir</i> with thir lateral noise,<br/>
<i>Sirocco</i>, and <i>Libecchio</i>. Thus began<br/>
Outrage from liveless things; but Discord first<br/>
Daughter of Sin, among th’ irrational,<br/>
Death introduc’d through fierce antipathie:<br/>
Beast now with Beast gan war, &amp; Fowle with Fowle,<br/>
And Fish with Fish; to graze the Herb all leaving,<br/>
Devourd each other; nor stood much in awe<br/>
Of Man, but fled him, or with count’nance grim<br/>
Glar’d on him passing: these were from without<br/>
The growing miseries, which <i>Adam</i> saw<br/>
Alreadie in part, though hid in gloomiest shade,<br/>
To sorrow abandond, but worse felt within,<br/>
And in a troubl’d Sea of passion tost,<br/>
Thus to disburd’n sought with sad complaint.<br/>
</p>
<p class="poem">
O miserable of happie! is this the end<br/>
Of this new glorious World, and mee so late<br/>
The Glory of that Glory, who now becom<br/>
Accurst of blessed, hide me from the face<br/>
Of God, whom to behold was then my highth<br/>
Of happiness: yet well, if here would end<br/>
The miserie, I deserv’d it, and would beare<br/>
My own deservings; but this will not serve;<br/>
All that I eate or drink, or shall beget,<br/>
Is propagated curse.  O voice once heard<br/>
Delightfully, <i>Encrease and Multiply</i>,<br/>
Now death to heare! for what can I encrease<br/>
Or multiplie, but curses on my head?<br/>
Who of all Ages to succeed, but feeling<br/>
The evil on him brought by me, will curse<br/>
My Head, Ill fare our Ancestor impure,<br/>
For this we may thank <i>Adam</i>; but his thanks<br/>
Shall be the execration; so besides<br/>
Mine own that bide upon me, all from mee<br/>
Shall with a fierce reflux on mee redound,<br/>
On mee as on thir natural center light<br/>
Heavie, though in thir place.  O fleeting joyes<br/>
Of Paradise, deare bought with lasting woes!<br/>
Did I request thee, Maker, from my Clay<br/>
To mould me Man, did I sollicite thee<br/>
From darkness to promote me, or here place<br/>
In this delicious Garden? as my Will<br/>
Concurd not to my being, it were but right<br/>
And equal to reduce me to my dust,<br/>
Desirous to resigne, and render back<br/>
All I receav’d, unable to performe<br/>
Thy terms too hard, by which I was to hold<br/>
The good I sought not.  To the loss of that,<br/>
Sufficient penaltie, why hast thou added<br/>
The sense of endless woes? inexplicable<br/>
Thy Justice seems; yet to say truth, too late,<br/>
I thus contest; then should have been refusd<br/>
Those terms whatever, when they were propos’d:<br/>
Thou didst accept them; wilt thou enjoy the good,<br/>
Then cavil the conditions? and though God<br/>
Made thee without thy leave, what if thy Son<br/>
Prove disobedient, and reprov’d, retort,<br/>
Wherefore didst thou beget me? I sought it not:<br/>
Wouldst thou admit for his contempt of thee<br/>
That proud excuse? yet him not thy election,<br/>
But Natural necessity begot.<br/>
God made thee of choice his own, and of his own<br/>
To serve him, thy reward was of his grace,<br/>
Thy punishment then justly is at his Will.<br/>
Be it so, for I submit, his doom is fair,<br/>
That dust I am, and shall to dust returne:<br/>
O welcom hour whenever! why delayes<br/>
His hand to execute what his Decree<br/>
Fixd on this day? why do I overlive,<br/>
Why am I mockt with death, and length’nd out<br/>
To deathless pain? how gladly would I meet<br/>
Mortalitie my sentence, and be Earth<br/>
Insensible, how glad would lay me down<br/>
As in my Mothers lap? there I should rest<br/>
And sleep secure; his dreadful voice no more<br/>
Would Thunder in my ears, no fear of worse<br/>
To mee and to my ofspring would torment me<br/>
With cruel expectation.  Yet one doubt<br/>
Pursues me still, least all I cannot die,<br/>
Least that pure breath of Life, the Spirit of Man<br/>
Which God inspir’d, cannot together perish<br/>
With this corporeal Clod; then in the Grave,<br/>
Or in some other dismal place, who knows<br/>
But I shall die a living Death?  O thought<br/>
Horrid, if true! yet why? it was but breath<br/>
Of Life that sinn’d; what dies but what had life<br/>
And sin? the Bodie properly hath neither.<br/>
All of me then shall die: let this appease<br/>
The doubt, since humane reach no further knows.<br/>
For though the Lord of all be infinite,<br/>
Is his wrauth also? be it, man is not so,<br/>
But mortal doom’d.  How can he exercise<br/>
Wrath without end on Man whom Death must end?<br/>
Can he make deathless Death? that were to make<br/>
Strange contradiction, which to God himself<br/>
Impossible is held, as Argument<br/>
Of weakness, not of Power.  Will he, draw out,<br/>
For angers sake, finite to infinite<br/>
In punisht man, to satisfie his rigour<br/>
Satisfi’d never; that were to extend<br/>
His Sentence beyond dust and Natures Law,<br/>
By which all Causes else according still<br/>
To the reception of thir matter act,<br/>
Not to th’ extent of thir own Spheare.  But say<br/>
That Death be not one stroak, as I suppos’d,<br/>
Bereaving sense, but endless miserie<br/>
From this day onward, which I feel begun<br/>
Both in me, and without me, and so last<br/>
To perpetuitie; Ay me, that fear<br/>
Comes thundring back with dreadful revolution<br/>
On my defensless head; both Death and I<br/>
Am found Eternal, and incorporate both,<br/>
Nor I on my part single, in mee all<br/>
Posteritie stands curst: Fair Patrimonie<br/>
That I must leave ye, Sons; O were I able<br/>
To waste it all my self, and leave ye none!<br/>
So disinherited how would ye bless<br/>
Me now your Curse!  Ah, why should all mankind<br/>
For one mans fault thus guiltless be condemn’d,<br/>
If guiltless?  But from mee what can proceed,<br/>
But all corrupt, both Mind and Will deprav’d,<br/>
Not to do onely, but to will the same<br/>
With me? how can they acquitted stand<br/>
In sight of God?  Him after all Disputes<br/>
Forc’t I absolve: all my evasions vain<br/>
And reasonings, though through Mazes, lead me still<br/>
But to my own conviction: first and last<br/>
On mee, mee onely, as the sourse and spring<br/>
Of all corruption, all the blame lights due;<br/>
So might the wrauth, Fond wish! couldst thou support<br/>
That burden heavier then the Earth to bear,<br/>
Then all the world much heavier, though divided<br/>
With that bad Woman?  Thus what thou desir’st,<br/>
And what thou fearst, alike destroyes all hope<br/>
Of refuge, and concludes thee miserable<br/>
Beyond all past example and future,<br/>
To <i>Satan</i> onely like both crime and doom.<br/>
O Conscience, into what Abyss of fears<br/>
And horrors hast thou driv’n me; out of which<br/>
I find no way, from deep to deeper plung’d!<br/>
</p>
<p class="poem">
Thus <i>Adam</i> to himself lamented loud<br/>
Through the still Night, now now, as ere man fell,<br/>
Wholsom and cool, and mild, but with black Air<br/>
Accompanied, with damps and dreadful gloom,<br/>
Which to his evil Conscience represented<br/>
All things with double terror: On the ground<br/>
Outstretcht he lay, on the cold ground, and oft<br/>
Curs’d his Creation, Death as oft accus’d<br/>
Of tardie execution, since denounc’t<br/>
The day of his offence.  Why comes not Death,<br/>
Said hee, with one thrice acceptable stroke<br/>
To end me?  Shall Truth fail to keep her word,<br/>
Justice Divine not hast’n to be just?<br/>
But Death comes not at call, Justice Divine<br/>
Mends not her slowest pace for prayers or cries.<br/>
O Woods, O Fountains, Hillocks, Dales and Bowrs,<br/>
VVith other echo farr I taught your Shades<br/>
To answer, and resound farr other Song.<br/>
VVhom thus afflicted when sad <i>Eve</i> beheld,<br/>
Desolate where she sate, approaching nigh,<br/>
Soft words to his fierce passion she assay’d:<br/>
But her with stern regard he thus repell’d.<br/>

Out of my sight, thou Serpent, that name best<br/>
Befits thee with him leagu’d, thy self as false<br/>
And hateful; nothing wants, but that thy shape,<br/>
Like his, and colour Serpentine may shew<br/>
Thy inward fraud, to warn all Creatures from thee<br/>
Henceforth; least that too heav’nly form, pretended<br/>
To hellish falshood, snare them.  But for thee<br/>
I had persisted happie, had not thy pride<br/>
And wandring vanitie, when lest was safe,<br/>
Rejected my forewarning, and disdain’d<br/>
Not to be trusted, longing to be seen<br/>
Though by the Devil himself, him overweening<br/>
To over-reach, but with the Serpent meeting<br/>
Fool’d and beguil’d, by him thou, I by thee,<br/>
To trust thee from my side, imagin’d wise,<br/>
Constant, mature, proof against all assaults,<br/>
And understood not all was but a shew<br/>
Rather then solid vertu, all but a Rib<br/>
Crooked by nature, bent, as now appears,<br/>
More to the part sinister from me drawn,<br/>
Well if thrown out, as supernumerarie<br/>
To my just number found.  O why did God,<br/>
Creator wise, that peopl’d highest Heav’n<br/>
With Spirits Masculine, create at last<br/>
This noveltie on Earth, this fair defect<br/>
Of Nature, and not fill the World at once<br/>
With Men as Angels without Feminine,<br/>
Or find some other way to generate<br/>
Mankind? this mischief had not then befall’n,<br/>
And more that shall befall, innumerable<br/>
Disturbances on Earth through Femal snares,<br/>
And straight conjunction with this Sex: for either<br/>
He never shall find out fit Mate, but such<br/>
As some misfortune brings him, or mistake,<br/>
Or whom he wishes most shall seldom gain<br/>
Through her perverseness, but shall see her gaind<br/>
By a farr worse, or if she love, withheld<br/>
By Parents, or his happiest choice too late<br/>
Shall meet, alreadie linkt and Wedlock-bound<br/>
To a fell Adversarie, his hate or shame:<br/>
Which infinite calamitie shall cause<br/>

But rise, let us no more contend, nor blame<br/>

Tending to som relief of our extremes,<br/>

If care of our descent perplex us most,<br/>
Which must be born to certain woe, devourd<br/>
By Death at last, and miserable it is<br/>
To be to others cause of misery,<br/>
Our own begotten, and of our Loines to bring<br/>

That after wretched Life must be at last<br/>
Food for so foule a Monster, in thy power<br/>

Childless thou art, Childless remaine:<br/>
So Death shall be deceav’d his glut, and with us two<br/>
Be forc’d to satisfie his Rav’nous Maw.<br/>
But if thou judge it hard and difficult,<br/>
Conversing, looking, loving, to abstain<br/>
From Loves due Rites, Nuptial embraces sweet,<br/>
And with desire to languish without hope,<br/>
Before the present object languishing<br/>
With like desire, which would be miserie<br/>
And torment less then none of what we dread,<br/>
Then both our selves and Seed at once to free<br/>
From what we fear for both, let us make short,<br/>
Let us seek Death, or hee not found, supply<br/>
With our own hands his Office on our selves;<br/>
Why stand we longer shivering under feares,<br/>
That shew no end but Death, and have the power,<br/>
Of many wayes to die the shortest choosing,<br/>
Destruction with destruction to destroy.<br/>

She ended heer, or vehement despaire<br/>
Broke off the rest; so much of Death her thoughts<br/>
Had entertaind, as di’d her Cheeks with pale.<br/>
But <i>Adam</i> with such counsel nothing sway’d,<br/>
To better hopes his more attentive minde<br/>
Labouring had rais’d, and thus to <i>Eve</i> repli’d.<br/>
</p>
<p class="poem">
<i>Eve</i>, thy contempt of life and pleasure seems<br/>
To argue in thee somthing more sublime<br/>
And excellent then what thy minde contemnes;<br/>
But self-destruction therefore saught, refutes<br/>
That excellence thought in thee, and implies,<br/>
Not thy contempt, but anguish and regret<br/>
For loss of life and pleasure overlov’d.<br/>
Or if thou covet death, as utmost end<br/>
Of miserie, so thinking to evade<br/>
The penaltie pronounc’t, doubt not but God<br/>
Hath wiselier arm’d his vengeful ire then so<br/>
To be forestall’d; much more I fear least Death<br/>
So snatcht will not exempt us from the paine<br/>
We are by doom to pay; rather such acts<br/>
Of contumacie will provoke the highest<br/>
To make death in us live: Then let us seek<br/>
Som safer resolution, which methinks<br/>
I have in view, calling to minde with heed<br/>
Part of our Sentence, that thy Seed shall bruise<br/>
The Serpents head; piteous amends, unless<br/>
Be meant, whom I conjecture, our grand Foe<br/>
<i>Satan</i>, who in the Serpent hath contriv’d<br/>
Against us this deceit: to crush his head<br/>
Would be revenge indeed; which will be lost<br/>
By death brought on our selves, or childless days<br/>
Resolv’d, as thou proposest; so our Foe<br/>
Shall scape his punishment ordain’d, and wee<br/>
Instead shall double ours upon our heads.<br/>
No more be mention’d then of violence<br/>
Against our selves, and wilful barrenness,<br/>
That cuts us off from hope, and savours onely<br/>
Rancor and pride, impatience and despite,<br/>
Reluctance against God and his just yoke<br/>
Laid on our Necks.  Remember with what mild<br/>
And gracious temper he both heard and judg’d<br/>
Without wrauth or reviling; wee expected<br/>
Immediate dissolution, which we thought<br/>
Was meant by Death that day, when lo, to thee<br/>
Pains onely in Child-bearing were foretold,<br/>
And bringing forth, soon recompenc’t with joy,<br/>
Fruit of thy Womb: On mee the Curse aslope<br/>
Glanc’d on the ground, with labour I must earne<br/>
My bread; what harm?  Idleness had bin worse;<br/>
My labour will sustain me; and least Cold<br/>
Or Heat should injure us, his timely care<br/>
Hath unbesaught provided, and his hands<br/>
Cloath’d us unworthie, pitying while he judg’d;<br/>
How much more, if we pray him, will his ear<br/>
Be open, and his heart to pitie incline,<br/>
And teach us further by what means to shun<br/>
Th’ inclement Seasons, Rain, Ice, Hail and Snow,<br/>
Which now the Skie with various Face begins<br/>
To shew us in this Mountain, while the Winds<br/>
Blow moist and keen, shattering the graceful locks<br/>
Of these fair spreading Trees; which bids us seek<br/>
Som better shroud, som better warmth to cherish<br/>
Our Limbs benumm’d, ere this diurnal Starr<br/>
Leave cold the Night, how we his gather’d beams<br/>
Reflected, may with matter sere foment,<br/>
Or by collision of two bodies grinde<br/>
The Air attrite to Fire, as late the Clouds<br/>
Justling or pusht with Winds rude in thir shock<br/>
Tine the slant Lightning, whose thwart flame driv’n down<br/>
Kindles the gummie bark of Firr or Pine,<br/>
And sends a comfortable heat from farr,<br/>
Which might supplie the Sun: such Fire to use,<br/>
And what may else be remedie or cure<br/>
To evils which our own misdeeds have wrought,<br/>
Hee will instruct us praying, and of Grace<br/>
Beseeching him, so as we need not fear<br/>
To pass commodiously this life, sustain’d<br/>
By him with many comforts, till we end<br/>
In dust, our final rest and native home.<br/>
What better can we do, then to the place<br/>
Repairing where he judg’d us, prostrate fall<br/>
Before him reverent, and there confess<br/>
Humbly our faults, and pardon beg, with tears<br/>
VVatering the ground, and with our sighs the Air<br/>
Frequenting, sent from hearts contrite, in sign<br/>
Of sorrow unfeign’d, and humiliation meek.<br/>
Undoubtedly he will relent and turn<br/>
From his displeasure; in whose look serene,<br/>
VVhen angry most he seem’d and most severe,<br/>
VVhat else but favor, grace, and mercie shon?<br/>
</p>
<p class="poem">
So spake our Father penitent, nor <i>Eve</i><br/>
Felt less remorse: they forthwith to the place<br/>
Repairing where he judg’d them prostrate fell<br/>
Before him reverent, and both confess’d<br/>
Humbly thir faults, and pardon beg’d, with tears<br/>
VVatering the ground, and with thir sighs the Air<br/>
Frequenting, sent from hearts contrite, in sign<br/>
Of sorrow unfeign’d, and humiliation meek.<br/>
