				<h3 epub:type="title">The Argument</h3>
				<p>The Son of God presents to his Father the prayers of our first
parents now repenting, and intercedes for them. God accepts them,
but declares that they must no longer abide in Paradise; sends Michael
with a band of Cherubim to dispossess them, but first to reveal to Adam
future things: Michael’s coming down. Adam shows to Eve certain
ominous signs; he discerns Michael’s approach; goes out to meet him:
the Angel denounces their departure. Eve’s lamentation. Adam pleads,
but submits: the Angel leads him up to a high hill; sets before him in
vision what shall happen till the Flood.</p>
