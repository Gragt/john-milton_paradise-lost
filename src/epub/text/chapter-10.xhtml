				<p class="pfirst">Thus they in lowliest plight repentant stood<br/>
Praying, for from the Mercie-seat above<br/>
Prevenient Grace descending had remov’d<br/>
The stonie from thir hearts, and made new flesh<br/>
Regenerat grow instead, that sighs now breath’d<br/>
Unutterable, which the Spirit of prayer<br/>
Inspir’d, and wing’d for Heav’n with speedier flight<br/>
Then loudest Oratorie: yet thir port<br/>
Not of mean suiters, nor important less<br/>
Seem’d thir Petition, then when th’ ancient Pair<br/>
In Fables old, less ancient yet then these,<br/>
<i>Deucalion</i> and chaste <i>Pyrrha</i> to restore<br/>
The Race of Mankind drownd, before the Shrine<br/>
Of <i>Themis</i> stood devout.  To Heav’n thir prayers<br/>
Flew up, nor missed the way, by envious windes<br/>
Blow’n vagabond or frustrate: in they passd<br/>
Dimentionless through Heav’nly dores; then clad<br/>
With incense, where the Golden Altar fum’d,<br/>
By thir great Intercessor, came in sight<br/>
Before the Fathers Throne: Them the glad Son<br/>
Presenting, thus to intercede began.<br/>
</p>
				<p class="poem">See Father, what first fruits on Earth are sprung<br/>
From thy implanted Grace in Man, these Sighs<br/>
And Prayers, which in this Golden Censer, mixt<br/>
With Incense, I thy Priest before thee bring,<br/>
Fruits of more pleasing savour from thy seed<br/>
Sow’n with contrition in his heart, then those<br/>
Which his own hand manuring all the Trees<br/>
Of Paradise could have produc’t, ere fall’n<br/>
From innocence.  Now therefore bend thine eare<br/>
To supplication, heare his sighs though mute;<br/>
Unskilful with what words to pray, let mee<br/>
Interpret for him, mee his Advocate<br/>
And propitiation, all his works on mee<br/>
Good or not good ingraft, my Merit those<br/>
Shall perfet, and for these my Death shall pay.<br/>
Accept me, and in mee from these receave<br/>
The smell of peace toward Mankinde, let him live<br/>
Before thee reconcil’d, at least his days<br/>
Numberd, though sad, till Death, his doom (which I<br/>
To mitigate thus plead, not to reverse)<br/>
To better life shall yeeld him, where with mee<br/>
All my redeemd may dwell in joy and bliss,<br/>
Made one with me as I with thee am one.<br/>
</p>
				<p class="poem">To whom the Father, without Cloud, serene.<br/>
All thy request for Man, accepted Son,<br/>
Obtain, all thy request was my Decree:<br/>
But longer in that Paradise to dwell,<br/>
The Law I gave to Nature him forbids:<br/>
Those pure immortal Elements that know<br/>
No gross, no unharmoneous mixture foule,<br/>
Eject him tainted now, and purge him off<br/>
As a distemper, gross to aire as gross,<br/>
And mortal food, as may dispose him best<br/>
For dissolution wrought by Sin, that first<br/>
Distemperd all things, and of incorrupt<br/>
Corrupted.  I at first with two fair gifts<br/>
Created him endowd, with Happiness<br/>
And Immortalitie: that fondly lost,<br/>
This other serv’d but to eternize woe;<br/>
Till I provided Death; so Death becomes<br/>
His final remedie, and after Life<br/>
Tri’d in sharp tribulation, and refin’d<br/>
By Faith and faithful works, to second Life,<br/>
Wak’t in the renovation of the just,<br/>
Resignes him up with Heav’n and Earth renewd.<br/>
But let us call to Synod all the Blest<br/>
Through Heav’ns wide bounds; from them I will not hide<br/>
My judgments, how with Mankind I proceed,<br/>
As how with peccant Angels late they saw;<br/>
And in thir state, though firm, stood more confirmd.<br/>
</p>
				<p class="poem">He ended, and the Son gave signal high<br/>
To the bright Minister that watchd, hee blew<br/>
His Trumpet, heard in <i>Oreb</i> since perhaps<br/>
When God descended, and perhaps once more<br/>
To sound at general Doom.  Th’ Angelic blast<br/>
Filld all the Regions: from thir blissful Bowrs<br/>
Of <i>Amarantin</i> Shade, Fountain or Spring,<br/>
By the waters of Life, where ere they sate<br/>
In fellowships of joy: the Sons of Light<br/>
Hasted, resorting to the Summons high,<br/>
And took thir Seats; till from his Throne supream<br/>
Th’ Almighty thus pronounced his sovran Will.<br/>
</p>
				<p class="poem">O Sons, like one of us Man is become<br/>
To know both Good and Evil, since his taste<br/>
Of that defended Fruit; but let him boast<br/>
His knowledge of Good lost, and Evil got,<br/>
Happier, had it suffic’d him to have known<br/>
Good by it self, and Evil not at all.<br/>
He sorrows now, repents, and prayes contrite,<br/>
My motions in him, longer then they move,<br/>
His heart I know, how variable and vain<br/>
Self-left.  Least therefore his now bolder hand<br/>
Reach also of the Tree of Life, and eat,<br/>
And live for ever, dream at least to live<br/>
Forever, to remove him I decree,<br/>
And send him from the Garden forth to Till<br/>
The Ground whence he was taken, fitter soile.<br/>
</p>
				<p class="poem"><i>Michael</i>, this my behest have thou in charge,<br/>
Take to thee from among the Cherubim<br/>
Thy choice of flaming Warriours, least the Fiend<br/>
Or in behalf of Man, or to invade<br/>
Vacant possession som new trouble raise:<br/>
Hast thee, and from the Paradise of God<br/>
Without remorse drive out the sinful Pair,<br/>
From hallowd ground th’ unholie, and denounce<br/>
To them and to thir Progenie from thence<br/>
Perpetual banishment.  Yet least they faint<br/>
At the sad Sentence rigorously urg’d,<br/>
For I behold them soft’nd and with tears<br/>
Bewailing thir excess, all terror hide.<br/>
If patiently thy bidding they obey,<br/>
Dismiss them not disconsolate; reveale<br/>
To <i>Adam</i> what shall come in future dayes,<br/>
As I shall thee enlighten, intermix<br/>
My Cov’nant in the Womans seed renewd;<br/>
So send them forth, though sorrowing, yet in peace:<br/>
And on the East side of the Garden place,<br/>
Where entrance up from <i>Eden</i> easiest climbes,<br/>
Cherubic watch, and of a Sword the flame<br/>
Wide waving, all approach farr off to fright,<br/>
And guard all passage to the Tree of Life:<br/>
Least Paradise a receptacle prove<br/>
To Spirits foule, and all my Trees thir prey,<br/>
With whose stol’n Fruit Man once more to delude.<br/>
</p>
				<p class="poem">He ceas’d; and th’ Archangelic Power prepar’d<br/>
For swift descent, with him the Cohort bright<br/>
Of watchful Cherubim; four faces each<br/>
Had, like a double <i>Janus</i>, all thir shape<br/>
Spangl’d with eyes more numerous then those<br/>
Of <i>Argus</i>, and more wakeful then to drouze,<br/>
Charm’d with <i>Arcadian</i> Pipe, the Pastoral Reed<br/>
Of <i>Hermes</i>, or his opiate Rod.  Meanwhile<br/>
To resalute the World with sacred Light<br/>
<i>Leucothea</i> wak’d, and with fresh dews imbalmd<br/>
The Earth, when <i>Adam</i> and first Matron <i>Eve</i><br/>
Had ended now thir Orisons, and found,<br/>
Strength added from above, new hope to spring<br/>
Out of despaire, joy, but with fear yet linkt;<br/>
Which thus to <i>Eve</i> his welcome words renewd.<br/>
</p>
				<p class="poem"><i>Eve</i>, easily may Faith admit, that all<br/>
The good which we enjoy, from Heav’n descends<br/>
But that from us ought should ascend to Heav’n<br/>
So prevalent as to concerne the mind<br/>
Of God high blest, or to incline his will,<br/>
Hard to belief may seem; yet this will Prayer,<br/>
Or one short sigh of humane breath, up-borne<br/>
Ev’n to the Seat of God.  For since I saught<br/>
By Prayer th’ offended Deitie to appease,<br/>
Kneel’d and before him humbl’d all my heart,<br/>
Methought I saw him placable and mild,<br/>
Bending his eare; perswasion in me grew<br/>
That I was heard with favour; peace returnd<br/>
Home to my brest, and to my memorie<br/>
His promise, that thy Seed shall bruise our Foe;<br/>
Which then not minded in dismay, yet now<br/>
Assures me that the bitterness of death<br/>
Is past, and we shall live.  Whence Haile to thee,<br/>
<i>Eve</i> rightly call’d, Mother of all Mankind,<br/>
Mother of all things living, since by thee<br/>
Man is to live, and all things live for Man.<br/>
</p>
				<p class="poem">To whom thus <i>Eve</i> with sad demeanour meek.<br/>
Ill worthie I such title should belong<br/>
To me transgressour, who for thee ordaind<br/>
A help, became thy snare; to mee reproach<br/>
Rather belongs, distrust and all dispraise:<br/>
But infinite in pardon was my Judge,<br/>
That I who first brought Death on all, am grac’t<br/>
The sourse of life; next favourable thou,<br/>
Who highly thus to entitle me voutsaf’t,<br/>
Farr other name deserving.  But the Field<br/>
To labour calls us now with sweat impos’d,<br/>
Though after sleepless Night; for see the Morn,<br/>
All unconcern’d with our unrest, begins<br/>
Her rosie progress smiling; let us forth,<br/>
I never from thy side henceforth to stray,<br/>
Wherere our days work lies, though now enjoind<br/>
Laborious, till day droop; while here we dwell,<br/>
What can be toilsom in these pleasant Walkes?<br/>
Here let us live, though in fall’n state, content.<br/>
</p>
				<p class="poem">So spake, so wish’d much-humbl’d <i>Eve</i>, but Fate<br/>
Subscrib’d not; Nature first gave Signs, imprest<br/>
On Bird, Beast, Aire, Aire suddenly eclips’d<br/>
After short blush of Morn; nigh in her sight<br/>
The Bird of <i>Jove</i>, stoopt from his aerie tour,<br/>
Two Birds of gayest plume before him drove:<br/>
Down from a Hill the Beast that reigns in Woods,<br/>
First Hunter then, pursu’d a gentle brace,<br/>
Goodliest of all the Forrest, Hart and Hinde;<br/>
Direct to th’ Eastern Gate was bent thir flight.<br/>
<i>Adam</i> observ’d, and with his Eye the chase<br/>
Pursuing, not unmov’d to <i>Eve</i> thus spake.<br/>
</p>
				<p class="poem">O <i>Eve</i>, some furder change awaits us nigh,<br/>
Which Heav’n by these mute signs in Nature shews<br/>
Forerunners of his purpose, or to warn<br/>
Us haply too secure of our discharge<br/>
From penaltie, because from death releast<br/>
Some days; how long, and what till then our life,<br/>
Who knows, or more then this, that we are dust,<br/>
And thither must return and be no more.<br/>
VVhy else this double object in our sight<br/>
Of flight pursu’d in th’ Air and ore the ground<br/>
One way the self-same hour? why in the East<br/>
Darkness ere Dayes mid-course, and Morning light<br/>
More orient in yon VVestern Cloud that draws<br/>
O’re the blew Firmament a radiant white,<br/>
And slow descends, with somthing heav’nly fraught.<br/>
</p>
				<p class="poem">He err’d not, for by this the heav’nly Bands<br/>
Down from a Skie of Jasper lighted now<br/>
In Paradise, and on a Hill made alt,<br/>
A glorious Apparition, had not doubt<br/>
And carnal fear that day dimm’d <i>Adams</i> eye.<br/>
Not that more glorious, when the Angels met<br/>
<i>Jacob</i> in <i>Mahanaim</i>, where he saw<br/>
The field Pavilion’d with his Guardians bright;<br/>
Nor that which on the flaming Mount appeerd<br/>
In <i>Dothan</i>, cover’d with a Camp of Fire,<br/>
Against the <i>Syrian</i> King, who to surprize<br/>
One man, Assassin-like had levied Warr,<br/>
Warr unproclam’d.  The Princely Hierarch<br/>
In thir bright stand, there left his Powers to seise<br/>
Possession of the Garden; hee alone,<br/>
To finde where <i>Adam</i> shelterd, took his way,<br/>
Not unperceav’d of <i>Adam</i>, who to <i>Eve</i>,<br/>
While the great Visitant approachd, thus spake.<br/>
</p>
				<p class="poem"><i>Eve</i>, now expect great tidings, which perhaps<br/>
Of us will soon determin, or impose<br/>
New Laws to be observ’d; for I descrie<br/>
From yonder blazing Cloud that veils the Hill<br/>
One of the heav’nly Host, and by his Gate<br/>
None of the meanest, some great Potentate<br/>
Or of the Thrones above, such Majestie<br/>
Invests him coming; yet not terrible,<br/>
That I should fear, nor sociably mild,<br/>
As <i>Raphael</i>, that I should much confide,<br/>
But solemn and sublime, whom not to offend,<br/>
With reverence I must meet, and thou retire.<br/>
He ended; and th’ Arch-Angel soon drew nigh,<br/>
Not in his shape Celestial, but as Man<br/>
Clad to meet Man; over his lucid Armes<br/>
A militarie Vest of purple flowd<br/>
Livelier then <i>Meliboean</i>, or the graine<br/>
Of <i>Sarra</i>, worn by Kings and Hero’s old<br/>
In time of Truce; <i>Iris</i> had dipt the wooff;<br/>
His starrie Helme unbuckl’d shew’d him prime<br/>
In Manhood where Youth ended; by his side<br/>
As in a glistering <i>Zodiac</i> hung the Sword,<br/>
Satans dire dread, and in his hand the Spear.<br/>
<i>Adam</i> bowd low, hee Kingly from his State<br/>
Inclin’d not, but his coming thus declar’d.<br/>
</p>
				<p class="poem"><i>Adam</i>, Heav’ns high behest no Preface needs:<br/>
Sufficient that thy Prayers are heard, and Death,<br/>
Then due by sentence when thou didst transgress,<br/>
Defeated of his seisure many dayes<br/>
Giv’n thee of Grace, wherein thou may’st repent,<br/>
And one bad act with many deeds well done<br/>
Mayst cover: well may then thy Lord appeas’d<br/>
Redeem thee quite from Deaths rapacious claimes;<br/>
But longer in this Paradise to dwell<br/>
Permits not; to remove thee I am come,<br/>
And send thee from the Garden forth to till<br/>
The ground whence thou wast tak’n, fitter Soile.<br/>
</p>
				<p class="poem">He added not, for <i>Adam</i> at the newes<br/>
Heart-strook with chilling gripe of sorrow stood,<br/>
That all his senses bound; <i>Eve</i>, who unseen<br/>
Yet all had heard, with audible lament<br/>
Discover’d soon the place of her retire.<br/>
</p>
				<p class="poem">O unexpected stroke, worse then of Death!<br/>
Must I thus leave thee Paradise? thus leave<br/>
Thee Native Soile, these happie Walks and Shades,<br/>
Fit haunt of Gods? where I had hope to spend,<br/>
Quiet though sad, the respit of that day<br/>
That must be mortal to us both.  O flours,<br/>
That never will in other Climate grow,<br/>
My early visitation, and my last<br/>
At Eev’n, which I bred up with tender hand<br/>
From the first op’ning bud, and gave ye Names,<br/>
Who now shall reare ye to the Sun, or ranke<br/>
Your Tribes, and water from th’ ambrosial Fount?<br/>
Thee lastly nuptial Bowre, by mee adornd<br/>
With what to sight or smell was sweet; from thee<br/>
How shall I part, and whither wander down<br/>
Into a lower World, to this obscure<br/>
And wilde, how shall we breath in other Aire<br/>
Less pure, accustomd to immortal Fruits?<br/>
</p>
				<p class="poem">Whom thus the Angel interrupted milde.<br/>
Lament not <i>Eve</i>, but patiently resigne<br/>
What justly thou hast lost; nor set thy heart,<br/>
Thus over fond, on that which is not thine;<br/>
Thy going is not lonely, with thee goes<br/>
Thy Husband, him to follow thou art bound;<br/>
Where he abides, think there thy native soile.<br/>
</p>
				<p class="poem"><i>Adam</i> by this from the cold sudden damp<br/>
Recovering, and his scatterd spirits returnd,<br/>
To <i>Michael</i> thus his humble words addressd.<br/>
</p>
				<p class="poem">Celestial, whether among the Thrones, or nam’d<br/>
Of them the Highest, for such of shape may seem<br/>
Prince above Princes, gently hast thou tould<br/>
Thy message, which might else in telling wound,<br/>
And in performing end us; what besides<br/>
Of sorrow and dejection and despair<br/>
Our frailtie can sustain, thy tidings bring,<br/>
Departure from this happy place, our sweet<br/>
Recess, and onely consolation left<br/>
Familiar to our eyes, all places else<br/>
Inhospitable appeer and desolate,<br/>
Nor knowing us nor known: and if by prayer<br/>
Incessant I could hope to change the will<br/>
Of him who all things can, I would not cease<br/>
To wearie him with my assiduous cries:<br/>
But prayer against his absolute Decree<br/>
No more availes then breath against the winde,<br/>
Blown stifling back on him that breaths it forth:<br/>
Therefore to his great bidding I submit.<br/>
This most afflicts me, that departing hence,<br/>
As from his face I shall be hid, deprivd<br/>
His blessed count’nance; here I could frequent,<br/>
With worship, place by place where he voutsaf’d<br/>
Presence Divine, and to my Sons relate;<br/>
On this Mount he appeerd, under this Tree<br/>
Stood visible, among these Pines his voice<br/>
I heard, here with him at this Fountain talk’d:<br/>
So many grateful Altars I would reare<br/>
Of grassie Terfe, and pile up every Stone<br/>
Of lustre from the brook, in memorie,<br/>
Or monument to Ages, and thereon<br/>
Offer sweet smelling Gumms &amp; Fruits and Flours:<br/>
In yonder nether World where shall I seek<br/>
His bright appearances, or footstep trace?<br/>
For though I fled him angrie, yet recall’d<br/>
To life prolongd and promisd Race, I now<br/>
Gladly behold though but his utmost skirts<br/>
Of glory, and farr off his steps adore.<br/>
</p>
				<p class="poem">To whom thus <i>Michael</i> with regard benigne.<br/>
<i>Adam</i>, thou know’st Heav’n his, and all the Earth<br/>
Not this Rock onely; his Omnipresence fills<br/>
Land, Sea, and Aire, and every kinde that lives,<br/>
Fomented by his virtual power and warmd:<br/>
All th’ Earth he gave thee to possess and rule,<br/>
No despicable gift; surmise not then<br/>
His presence to these narrow bounds confin’d<br/>
Of Paradise or <i>Eden</i>: this had been<br/>
Perhaps thy Capital Seate, from whence had spred<br/>
All generations, and had hither come<br/>
From all the ends of th’ Earth, to celebrate<br/>
And reverence thee thir great Progenitor.<br/>
But this praeeminence thou hast lost, brought down<br/>
To dwell on eeven ground now with thy Sons:<br/>
Yet doubt not but in Vallie and in Plaine<br/>
God is as here, and will be found alike<br/>
Present, and of his presence many a signe<br/>
Still following thee, still compassing thee round<br/>
With goodness and paternal Love, his Face<br/>
Express, and of his steps the track Divine.<br/>
Which that thou mayst beleeve, and be confirmd,<br/>
Ere thou from hence depart, know I am sent<br/>
To shew thee what shall come in future dayes<br/>
To thee and to thy Ofspring; good with bad<br/>
Expect to hear, supernal Grace contending<br/>
With sinfulness of Men; thereby to learn<br/>
True patience, and to temper joy with fear<br/>
And pious sorrow, equally enur’d<br/>
By moderation either state to beare,<br/>
Prosperous or adverse: so shalt thou lead<br/>
Safest thy life, and best prepar’d endure<br/>
Thy mortal passage when it comes.  Ascend<br/>
This Hill; let <i>Eve</i> (for I have drencht her eyes)<br/>
Here sleep below while thou to foresight wak’st,<br/>
As once thou slepst, while Shee to life was formd.<br/>
</p>
				<p class="poem">To whom thus <i>Adam</i> gratefully repli’d.<br/>
Ascend, I follow thee, safe Guide, the path<br/>
Thou lead’st me, and to the hand of Heav’n submit,<br/>
However chast’ning, to the evil turne<br/>
My obvious breast, arming to overcom<br/>
By suffering, and earne rest from labour won,<br/>
If so I may attain.  So both ascend<br/>
In the Visions of God:  It was a Hill<br/>
Of Paradise the highest, from whose top<br/>
The Hemisphere of Earth in cleerest Ken<br/>
Stretcht out to amplest reach of prospect lay.<br/>
Not higher that Hill nor wider looking round,<br/>
Whereon for different cause the Tempter set<br/>
Our second <i>Adam</i> in the Wilderness,<br/>
To shew him all Earths Kingdomes and thir Glory.<br/>
His Eye might there command wherever stood<br/>
City of old or modern Fame, the Seat<br/>
Of mightiest Empire, from the destind Walls<br/>
Of <i>Cambalu</i>, seat of <i>Cathaian Can</i><br/>
And <i>Samarchand</i> by <i>Oxus</i>, <i>Temirs</i> Throne,<br/>
To <i>Paquin</i> of <i>Sinaean</i> Kings, and thence<br/>
To <i>Agra</i> and <i>Lahor</i> of great <i>Mogul</i><br/>
Down to the golden <i>Chersones</i>, or where<br/>
The <i>Persian</i> in <i>Ecbatan</i> sate, or since<br/>
In <i>Hispahan</i>, or where the <i>Russian Ksar</i><br/>
In <i>Mosco</i>, or the Sultan in <i>Bizance</i>,<br/>
<i>Turchestan</i>-born; nor could his eye not ken<br/>
Th’ Empire of <i>Negus</i> to his utmost Port<br/>
<i>Ercoco</i> and the less Maritine Kings<br/>
<i>Mombaza</i>, and <i>Quiloa</i>, and <i>Melind</i>,<br/>
And <i>Sofala</i> thought <i>Ophir</i>, to the Realme<br/>
Of <i>Congo</i>, and <i>Angola</i> fardest South;<br/>
Or thence from <i>Niger</i> Flood to <i>Atlas</i> Mount<br/>
The Kingdoms of <i>Almansor</i>, <i>Fez</i>, and <i>Sus</i>,<br/>
<i>Marocco</i> and <i>Algiers</i>, and <i>Tremisen</i>;<br/>
On <i>Europe</i> thence, and where <i>Rome</i> was to sway<br/>
The VVorld: in Spirit perhaps he also saw<br/>
Rich <i>Mexico</i> the seat of <i>Motezume</i>,<br/>
And <i>Cusco</i> in <i>Peru</i>, the richer seat<br/>
Of <i>Atabalipa</i>, and yet unspoil’d<br/>
<i>Guiana</i>, whose great Citie <i>Geryons</i> Sons<br/>
Call <i>El Dorado:</i> but to nobler sights<br/>
<i>Michael</i> from <i>Adams</i> eyes the Filme remov’d<br/>
VVhich that false Fruit that promis’d clearer sight<br/>
Had bred; then purg’d with Euphrasie and Rue<br/>
The visual Nerve, for he had much to see;<br/>
And from the VVell of Life three drops instill’d.<br/>
So deep the power of these Ingredients pierc’d,<br/>
Eevn to the inmost seat of mental sight,<br/>
That <i>Adam</i> now enforc’t to close his eyes,<br/>
Sunk down and all his Spirits became intranst:<br/>
But him the gentle Angel by the hand<br/>
Soon rais’d, and his attention thus recall’d.<br/>
</p>
				<p class="poem"><i>Adam</i>, now ope thine eyes, and first behold<br/>
Th’ effects which thy original crime hath wrought<br/>
In some to spring from thee, who never touch’d<br/>
Th’ excepted Tree, nor with the Snake conspir’d,<br/>
Nor sinn’d thy sin, yet from that sin derive<br/>
Corruption to bring forth more violent deeds.<br/>
</p>
				<p class="poem">His eyes he op’nd, and beheld a field,<br/>
Part arable and tilth, whereon were Sheaves<br/>
New reapt, the other part sheep-walks and foulds;<br/>
Ith’ midst an Altar as the Land-mark stood<br/>
Rustic, of grassie sord; thither anon<br/>
A sweatie Reaper from his Tillage brought<br/>
First Fruits, the green Eare, and the yellow Sheaf,<br/>
Uncull’d, as came to hand; a Shepherd next<br/>
More meek came with the Firstlings of his Flock<br/>
Choicest and best; then sacrificing, laid<br/>
The Inwards and thir Fat, with Incense strew’d,<br/>
On the cleft Wood, and all due Rites perform’d.<br/>
His Offring soon propitious Fire from Heav’n<br/>
Consum’d with nimble glance, and grateful steame;<br/>
The others not, for his was not sincere;<br/>
Whereat hee inlie rag’d, and as they talk’d,<br/>
Smote him into the Midriff with a stone<br/>
That beat out life; he fell, and deadly pale<br/>
Groand out his Soul with gushing bloud effus’d.<br/>
Much at that sight was <i>Adam</i> in his heart<br/>
Dismai’d, and thus in haste to th’ Angel cri’d.<br/>
</p>
				<p class="poem">O Teacher, some great mischief hath befall’n<br/>
To that meek man, who well had sacrific’d;<br/>
Is Pietie thus and pure Devotion paid?<br/>
</p>
				<p class="poem">T’ whom <i>Michael</i> thus, hee also mov’d, repli’d.<br/>
These two are Brethren, <i>Adam</i>, and to come<br/>
Out of thy loyns; th’ unjust the just hath slain,<br/>
For envie that his Brothers Offering found<br/>
From Heav’n acceptance; but the bloodie Fact<br/>
Will be aveng’d, and th’ others Faith approv’d<br/>
Loose no reward, though here thou see him die,<br/>
Rowling in dust and gore.  To which our Sire.<br/>
</p>
				<p class="poem">Alas, both for the deed and for the cause!<br/>
But have I now seen Death?  Is this the way<br/>
I must return to native dust?  O sight<br/>
Of terrour, foul and ugly to behold,<br/>
Horrid to think, how horrible to feel!<br/>
</p>
				<p class="poem">To whom thus <i>Michael</i>.  Death thou hast seen<br/>
In his first shape on man; but many shapes<br/>
Of Death, and many are the wayes that lead<br/>
To his grim Cave, all dismal; yet to sense<br/>
More terrible at th’ entrance then within.<br/>
Some, as thou saw’st, by violent stroke shall die,<br/>
By Fire, Flood, Famin, by Intemperance more<br/>
In Meats and Drinks, which on the Earth shal bring<br/>
Diseases dire, of which a monstrous crew<br/>
Before thee shall appear; that thou mayst know<br/>
What miserie th’ inabstinence of <i>Eve</i><br/>
Shall bring on men.  Immediately a place<br/>
Before his eyes appeard, sad, noysom, dark,<br/>
A Lazar-house it seemd, wherein were laid<br/>
Numbers of all diseas’d, all maladies<br/>
Of gastly Spasm, or racking torture, qualmes<br/>
Of heart-sick Agonie, all feavorous kinds,<br/>
Convulsions, Epilepsies, fierce Catarrhs,<br/>
Intestin Stone and Ulcer, Colic pangs,<br/>
Dropsies, and Asthma’s, and Joint-racking Rheums.<br/>
Dire was the tossing, deep the groans, despair<br/>
Tended the sick busiest from Couch to Couch;<br/>
And over them triumphant Death his Dart<br/>
Shook, but delaid to strike, though oft invok’t<br/>
With vows, as thir chief good, and final hope.<br/>
Sight so deform what heart of Rock could long<br/>
Drie-ey’d behold?  <i>Adam</i> could not, but wept,<br/>
Though not of Woman born; compassion quell’d<br/>
His best of Man, and gave him up to tears<br/>
A space, till firmer thoughts restraind excess,<br/>
And scarce recovering words his plaint renew’d.<br/>
</p>
				<p class="poem">O miserable Mankind, to what fall<br/>
Degraded, to what wretched state reserv’d?<br/>
Better end heer unborn.  Why is life giv’n<br/>
To be thus wrested from us? rather why<br/>
Obtruded on us thus? who if we knew<br/>
What we receive, would either not accept<br/>
Life offer’d, or soon beg to lay it down,<br/>
Glad to be so dismist in peace.  Can thus<br/>
Th’ Image of God in man created once<br/>
So goodly and erect, though faultie since,<br/>
To such unsightly sufferings be debas’t<br/>
Under inhuman pains?  Why should not Man,<br/>
Retaining still Divine similitude<br/>
In part, from such deformities be free,<br/>
And for his Makers Image sake exempt?<br/>
</p>
				<p class="poem">Thir Makers Image, answerd <i>Michael</i>, then<br/>
Forsook them, when themselves they villifi’d<br/>
To serve ungovern’d appetite, and took<br/>
His Image whom they serv’d, a brutish vice,<br/>
Inductive mainly to the sin of <i>Eve</i>.<br/>
Therefore so abject is thir punishment,<br/>
Disfiguring not Gods likeness, but thir own,<br/>
Or if his likeness, by themselves defac’t<br/>
While they pervert pure Natures healthful rules<br/>
To loathsom sickness, worthily, since they<br/>
Gods Image did not reverence in themselves.<br/>

				<p class="poem">I yeild it just, said <i>Adam</i>, and submit.<br/>
But is there yet no other way, besides<br/>
These painful passages, how we may come<br/>
To Death, and mix with our connatural dust?<br/>
</p>
				<p class="poem">There is, said <i>Michael</i>, if thou well observe<br/>
The rule of not too much, by temperance taught<br/>
In what thou eatst and drinkst, seeking from thence<br/>
Due nourishment, not gluttonous delight,<br/>
Till many years over thy head return:<br/>
So maist thou live, till like ripe Fruit thou drop<br/>
Into thy Mothers lap, or be with ease<br/>
Gatherd, not harshly pluckt, for death mature:<br/>
This is old age; but then thou must outlive<br/>
Thy youth, thy strength, thy beauty, which will change<br/>
To witherd weak &amp; gray; thy Senses then<br/>
Obtuse, all taste of pleasure must forgoe,<br/>
To what thou hast, and for the Aire of youth<br/>
Hopeful and cheerful, in thy blood will reigne<br/>
A melancholly damp of cold and dry<br/>
To waigh thy spirits down, and last consume<br/>
The Balme of Life.  To whom our Ancestor.<br/>
</p>
				<p class="poem">Henceforth I flie not Death, nor would prolong<br/>
Life much, bent rather how I may be quit<br/>
Fairest and easiest of this combrous charge,<br/>
Which I must keep till my appointed day<br/>
Of rendring up.  <i>Michael</i> to him repli’d.<br/>

</p>
				<p class="poem">He lookd and saw a spacious Plaine, whereon<br/>
Were Tents of various hue; by some were herds<br/>
Of Cattel grazing: others, whence the sound<br/>
Of Instruments that made melodious chime<br/>
Was heard, of Harp and Organ; and who moovd<br/>
Thir stops and chords was seen: his volant touch<br/>
Instinct through all proportions low and high<br/>
Fled and pursu’d transverse the resonant fugue.<br/>
In other part stood one who at the Forge<br/>
Labouring, two massie clods of Iron and Brass<br/>
Had melted (whether found where casual fire<br/>
Had wasted woods on Mountain or in Vale,<br/>
Down to the veins of Earth, thence gliding hot<br/>
To som Caves mouth, or whether washt by stream<br/>
From underground) the liquid Ore he dreind<br/>
Into fit moulds prepar’d; from which he formd<br/>
First his own Tooles; then, what might else be wrought<br/>
Fulfil or grav’n in mettle.  After these,<br/>
But on the hether side a different sort<br/>
From the high neighbouring Hills, which was thir Seat,<br/>
Down to the Plain descended: by thir guise<br/>
Just men they seemd, and all thir study bent<br/>
To worship God aright, and know his works<br/>
Not hid, nor those things lost which might preserve<br/>
Freedom and Peace to men: they on the Plain<br/>
Long had not walkt, when from the Tents behold<br/>
A Beavie of fair Women, richly gay<br/>
In Gems and wanton dress; to the Harp they sung<br/>
Soft amorous Ditties, and in dance came on:<br/>
The Men though grave, ey’d them, and let thir eyes<br/>
Rove without rein, till in the amorous Net<br/>
Fast caught, they lik’d, and each his liking chose;<br/>
And now of love they treat till th’ Eevning Star<br/>
Loves Harbinger appeerd; then all in heat<br/>
They light the Nuptial Torch, and bid invoke<br/>
Hymen, then first to marriage Rites invok’t;<br/>
With Feast and Musick all the Tents resound.<br/>
Such happy interview and fair event<br/>
Of love &amp; youth not lost, Songs, Garlands, Flours,<br/>
And charming Symphonies attach’d the heart<br/>
Of <i>Adam</i>, soon enclin’d to admit delight,<br/>
The bent of Nature; which he thus express’d.<br/>
</p>
				<p class="poem">True opener of mine eyes, prime Angel blest,<br/>
Much better seems this Vision, and more hope<br/>
Of peaceful dayes portends, then those two past;<br/>
Those were of hate and death, or pain much worse,<br/>
Here Nature seems fulfilld in all her ends.<br/>
</p>
				<p class="poem">To whom thus <i>Michael</i>.  Judg not what is best<br/>
By pleasure, though to Nature seeming meet,<br/>
Created, as thou art, to nobler end<br/>
Holie and pure, conformitie divine.<br/>
Those Tents thou sawst so pleasant, were the Tents<br/>
Of wickedness, wherein shall dwell his Race<br/>
Who slew his Brother; studious they appere<br/>
Of Arts that polish Life, Inventers rare,<br/>
Unmindful of thir Maker, though his Spirit<br/>
Taught them, but they his gifts acknowledg’d none.<br/>
Yet they a beauteous ofspring shall beget;<br/>
For that fair femal Troop thou sawst, that seemd<br/>
Of Goddesses, so blithe, so smooth, so gay,<br/>
Yet empty of all good wherein consists<br/>
Womans domestic honour and chief praise;<br/>
Bred onely and completed to the taste<br/>
Of lustful apperence, to sing, to dance,<br/>
To dress, and troule the Tongue, and roule the Eye.<br/>
To these that sober Race of Men, whose lives<br/>
Religious titl’d them the Sons of God,<br/>
Shall yeild up all thir vertue, all thir fame<br/>
Ignobly, to the trains and to the smiles<br/>
Of these fair Atheists, and now swim in joy,<br/>
(Erelong to swim at larg) and laugh; for which<br/>
The world erelong a world of tears must weepe.<br/>
</p>
				<p class="poem">To whom thus <i>Adam</i> of short joy bereft.<br/>
O pittie and shame, that they who to live well<br/>
Enterd so faire, should turn aside to tread<br/>
Paths indirect, or in the mid way faint!<br/>
But still I see the tenor of Mans woe<br/>
Holds on the same, from Woman to begin.<br/>
</p>
				<p class="poem">From Mans effeminate slackness it begins,<br/>
Said th’ Angel, who should better hold his place<br/>
By wisdome, and superiour gifts receavd.<br/>
But now prepare thee for another Scene.<br/>
</p>
				<p class="poem">He lookd and saw wide Territorie spred<br/>
Before him, Towns, and rural works between,<br/>
Cities of Men with lofty Gates and Towrs,<br/>
Concours in Arms, fierce Faces threatning Warr,<br/>
Giants of mightie Bone, and bould emprise;<br/>
Part wield thir Arms, part courb the foaming Steed,<br/>
Single or in Array of Battel rang’d<br/>
Both Horse and Foot, nor idely mustring stood;<br/>
One way a Band select from forage drives<br/>
A herd of Beeves, faire Oxen and faire Kine<br/>
From a fat Meddow ground; or fleecy Flock,<br/>
Ewes and thir bleating Lambs over the Plaine,<br/>
Thir Bootie; scarce with Life the Shepherds flye,<br/>
But call in aide, which tacks a bloody Fray;<br/>
With cruel Tournament the Squadrons joine;<br/>
Where Cattel pastur’d late, now scatterd lies<br/>
With Carcasses and Arms th’ ensanguind Field<br/>
Deserted: Others to a Citie strong<br/>
Lay Siege, encampt; by Batterie, Scale, and Mine,<br/>
Assaulting; others from the Wall defend<br/>
With Dart and Jav’lin, Stones and sulfurous Fire;<br/>
On each hand slaughter and gigantic deeds.<br/>
In other part the scepter’d Haralds call<br/>
To Council in the Citie Gates: anon<br/>
Grey-headed men and grave, with Warriours mixt,<br/>
Assemble, and Harangues are heard, but soon<br/>
In factious opposition, till at last<br/>
Of middle Age one rising, eminent<br/>
In wise deport, spake much of Right and Wrong,<br/>
Of Justice, of Religion, Truth and Peace,<br/>
And Judgement from above: him old and young<br/>
Exploded, and had seiz’d with violent hands,<br/>
Had not a Cloud descending snatch’d him thence<br/>
Unseen amid the throng: so violence<br/>
Proceeded, and Oppression, and Sword-Law<br/>
Through all the Plain, and refuge none was found.<br/>
<i>Adam</i> was all in tears, and to his guide<br/>
Lamenting turnd full sad; O what are these,<br/>
Deaths Ministers, not Men, who thus deal Death<br/>
Inhumanly to men, and multiply<br/>
Ten thousand fould the sin of him who slew<br/>
His Brother; for of whom such massacher<br/>
Make they but of thir Brethren, men of men?<br/>
But who was that Just Man, whom had not Heav’n<br/>
Rescu’d, had in his Righteousness bin lost?<br/>
</p>
				<p class="poem">To whom thus <i>Michael</i>; These are the product<br/>
Of those ill-mated Marriages thou saw’st;<br/>
Where good with bad were matcht, who of themselves<br/>
Abhor to joyn; and by imprudence mixt,<br/>
Produce prodigious Births of bodie or mind.<br/>
Such were these Giants, men of high renown;<br/>
For in those dayes Might onely shall be admir’d,<br/>
And Valour and Heroic Vertu call’d;<br/>
To overcome in Battel, and subdue<br/>
Nations, and bring home spoils with infinite<br/>
Man-slaughter, shall be held the highest pitch<br/>
Of human Glorie, and for Glorie done<br/>
Of triumph, to be styl’d great Conquerours,<br/>
Patrons of Mankind, Gods, and Sons of Gods,<br/>
Destroyers rightlier call’d and Plagues of men.<br/>
Thus Fame shall be achiev’d, renown on Earth,<br/>
And what most merits fame in silence hid.<br/>
But hee the seventh from thee, whom thou beheldst<br/>
The onely righteous in a World perverse,<br/>
And therefore hated, therefore so beset<br/>
With Foes for daring single to be just,<br/>
And utter odious Truth, that God would come<br/>
To judge them with his Saints: Him the most High<br/>
Rapt in a balmie Cloud with winged Steeds<br/>
Did, as thou sawst, receave, to walk with God<br/>
High in Salvation and the Climes of bliss,<br/>
Exempt from Death; to shew thee what reward<br/>
Awaits the good, the rest what punishment;<br/>
Which now direct thine eyes and soon behold.<br/>
</p>
				<p class="poem">He look’d, &amp; saw the face of things quite chang’d;<br/>
The brazen Throat of Warr had ceast to roar,<br/>
All now was turn’d to jollitie and game,<br/>
To luxurie and riot, feast and dance,<br/>
Marrying or prostituting, as befell,<br/>
Rape or Adulterie, where passing faire<br/>
Allurd them; thence from Cups to civil Broiles.<br/>
At length a Reverend Sire among them came,<br/>
And of thir doings great dislike declar’d,<br/>
And testifi’d against thir wayes; hee oft<br/>
Frequented thir Assemblies, whereso met,<br/>
Triumphs or Festivals, and to them preachd<br/>
Conversion and Repentance, as to Souls<br/>
In prison under Judgements imminent:<br/>
But all in vain: which when he saw, he ceas’d<br/>
Contending, and remov’d his Tents farr off;<br/>
Then from the Mountain hewing Timber tall,<br/>
Began to build a Vessel of huge bulk,<br/>
Measur’d by Cubit, length, &amp; breadth, and highth,<br/>
Smeard round with Pitch, and in the side a dore<br/>
Contriv’d, and of provisions laid in large<br/>
For Man and Beast: when loe a wonder strange!<br/>
Of everie Beast, and Bird, and Insect small<br/>
Came seavens, and pairs, and enterd in, as taught<br/>
Thir order; last the Sire, and his three Sons<br/>
With thir four Wives, and God made fast the dore.<br/>
Meanwhile the Southwind rose, &amp; with black wings<br/>
Wide hovering, all the Clouds together drove<br/>
From under Heav’n; the Hills to their supplie<br/>
Vapour, and Exhalation dusk and moist,<br/>
Sent up amain; and now the thick’nd Skie<br/>
Like a dark Ceeling stood; down rush’d the Rain<br/>
Impetuous, and continu’d till the Earth<br/>
No more was seen; the floating Vessel swum<br/>
Uplifted; and secure with beaked prow<br/>
Rode tilting o’re the Waves, all dwellings else<br/>
Flood overwhelmd, and them with all thir pomp<br/>
Deep under water rould; Sea cover’d Sea,<br/>
Sea without shoar; and in thir Palaces<br/>
Where luxurie late reign’d, Sea-monsters whelp’d<br/>
And stabl’d; of Mankind, so numerous late,<br/>
All left, in one small bottom swum imbark’t.<br/>
How didst thou grieve then, <i>Adam</i>, to behold<br/>
The end of all thy Ofspring, end so sad,<br/>
Depopulation; thee another Floud,<br/>
Of tears and sorrow a Floud thee also drown’d,<br/>
And sunk thee as thy Sons; till gently reard<br/>
By th’ Angel, on thy feet thou stoodst at last,<br/>
Though comfortless, as when a Father mourns<br/>
His Childern, all in view destroyd at once;<br/>
And scarce to th’ Angel utterdst thus thy plaint.<br/>
</p>
				<p class="poem">O Visions ill foreseen! better had I<br/>
Liv’d ignorant of future, so had borne<br/>
My part of evil onely, each dayes lot<br/>
Anough to bear; those now, that were dispenst<br/>
The burd’n of many Ages, on me light<br/>
At once, by my foreknowledge gaining Birth<br/>
Abortive, to torment me ere thir being,<br/>
With thought that they must be.  Let no man seek<br/>
Henceforth to be foretold what shall befall<br/>
Him or his Childern, evil he may be sure,<br/>
Which neither his foreknowing can prevent,<br/>

When violence was ceas’t, and Warr on Earth,<br/>
All would have then gon well, peace would have crownd<br/>
With length of happy days the race of man;<br/>
But I was farr deceav’d; for now I see<br/>
Peace to corrupt no less then Warr to waste.<br/>
How comes it thus? unfould, Celestial Guide,<br/>
And whether here the Race of man will end.<br/>
To whom thus <i>Michael</i>.  Those whom last thou sawst<br/>
In triumph and luxurious wealth, are they<br/>
First seen in acts of prowess eminent<br/>
And great exploits, but of true vertu void;<br/>
Who having spilt much blood, and don much waste<br/>
Subduing Nations, and achievd thereby<br/>
Fame in the World, high titles, and rich prey,<br/>
Shall change thir course to pleasure, ease, and sloth,<br/>
Surfet, and lust, till wantonness and pride<br/>
Raise out of friendship hostil deeds in Peace.<br/>
The conquerd also, and enslav’d by Warr<br/>
Shall with thir freedom lost all vertu loose<br/>
And feare of God, from whom thir pietie feign’d<br/>
In sharp contest of Battel found no aide<br/>
Against invaders; therefore coold in zeale<br/>
Thenceforth shall practice how to live secure,<br/>
Worldlie or dissolute, on what thir Lords<br/>
Shall leave them to enjoy; for th’ Earth shall bear<br/>
More then anough, that temperance may be tri’d:<br/>
So all shall turn degenerate, all deprav’d,<br/>
Justice and Temperance, Truth and Faith forgot;<br/>
One Man except, the onely Son of light<br/>
In a dark Age, against example good,<br/>
Against allurement, custom, and a World<br/>
Offended; fearless of reproach and scorn,<br/>
Or violence, hee of thir wicked wayes<br/>
Shall them admonish, and before them set<br/>
The paths of righteousness, how much more safe,<br/>
And full of peace, denouncing wrauth to come<br/>
On thir impenitence; and shall returne<br/>
Of them derided, but of God observd<br/>
The one just Man alive; by his command<br/>
Shall build a wondrous Ark, as thou beheldst,<br/>
To save himself and houshold from amidst<br/>
A World devote to universal rack.<br/>
No sooner hee with them of Man and Beast<br/>
Select for life shall in the Ark be lodg’d,<br/>
And shelterd round, but all the Cataracts<br/>
Of Heav’n set open on the Earth shall powre<br/>
Raine day and night, all fountaines of the Deep<br/>
Broke up, shall heave the Ocean to usurp<br/>
Beyond all bounds, till inundation rise<br/>
Above the highest Hills: then shall this Mount<br/>
Of Paradise by might of Waves be moovd<br/>
Out of his place, pushd by the horned floud,<br/>
With all his verdure spoil’d, and Trees adrift<br/>
Down the great River to the op’ning Gulf,<br/>
And there take root an Iland salt and bare,<br/>
The haunt of Seales and Orcs, and Sea-mews clang.<br/>
To teach thee that God attributes to place<br/>
No sanctitie, if none be thither brought<br/>
By Men who there frequent, or therein dwell.<br/>
And now what further shall ensue, behold.<br/>
</p>
				<p class="poem">He lookd, and saw the Ark hull on the floud,<br/>
Which now abated, for the Clouds were fled,<br/>
Drivn by a keen North-winde, that blowing drie<br/>
Wrinkl’d the face of Deluge, as decai’d;<br/>
And the cleer Sun on his wide watrie Glass<br/>
Gaz’d hot, and of the fresh Wave largely drew,<br/>
As after thirst, which made thir flowing shrink<br/>
From standing lake to tripping ebbe, that stole<br/>
With soft foot towards the deep, who now had stopt<br/>
His Sluces, as the Heav’n his windows shut.<br/>
The Ark no more now flotes, but seems on ground<br/>
Fast on the top of som high mountain fixt.<br/>
And now the tops of Hills as Rocks appeer;<br/>
With clamor thence the rapid Currents drive<br/>
Towards the retreating Sea thir furious tyde.<br/>
Forthwith from out the Arke a Raven flies,<br/>
And after him, the surer messenger,<br/>
A Dove sent forth once and agen to spie<br/>
Green Tree or ground whereon his foot may light;<br/>
The second time returning, in his Bill<br/>
An Olive leafe he brings, pacific signe:<br/>
Anon drie ground appeers, and from his Arke<br/>
The ancient Sire descends with all his Train;<br/>
Then with uplifted hands, and eyes devout,<br/>
Grateful to Heav’n, over his head beholds<br/>
A dewie Cloud, and in the Cloud a Bow<br/>
Conspicuous with three lifted colours gay,<br/>
Betok’ning peace from God, and Cov’nant new.<br/>
Whereat the heart of <i>Adam</i> erst so sad<br/>
Greatly rejoyc’d, and thus his joy broke forth.<br/>

At this last sight, assur’d that Man shall live<br/>

Farr less I now lament for one whole World<br/>
Of wicked Sons destroyd, then I rejoyce<br/>
For one Man found so perfet and so just,<br/>
That God voutsafes to raise another World<br/>
From him, and all his anger to forget.<br/>
But say, what mean those colourd streaks in Heavn,<br/>
Distended as the Brow of God appeas’d,<br/>
Or serve they as a flourie verge to binde<br/>

So willingly doth God remit his Ire,<br/>
Though late repenting him of Man deprav’d,<br/>
Griev’d at his heart, when looking down he saw<br/>
The whole Earth fill’d with violence, and all flesh<br/>
Corrupting each thir way; yet those remoov’d,<br/>
Such grace shall one just Man find in his sight,<br/>
That he relents, not to blot out mankind,<br/>
And makes a Covenant never to destroy<br/>
The Earth again by flood, nor let the Sea<br/>
Surpass his bounds, nor Rain to drown the World<br/>
With Man therein or Beast; but when he brings<br/>
Over the Earth a Cloud, will therein set<br/>
His triple-colour’d Bow, whereon to look<br/>

Seed time and Harvest, Heat and hoary Frost<br/>
Shall hold thir course, till fire purge all things new,<br/>
Both Heav’n and Earth, wherein the just shall dwell.<br/>
Thus thou hast seen one World begin and end;<br/>
And Man as from a second stock proceed.<br/>
Much thou hast yet to see, but I perceave<br/>
Thy mortal sight to faile; objects divine<br/>
Must needs impaire and wearie human sense:<br/>
Henceforth what is to com I will relate,<br/>

This second sours of Men, while yet but few,<br/>
And while the dread of judgement past remains<br/>
Fresh in thir mindes, fearing the Deitie,<br/>
With some regard to what is just and right<br/>
Shall lead thir lives, and multiplie apace,<br/>
Labouring the soile, and reaping plenteous crop,<br/>
Corn wine and oyle; and from the herd or flock,<br/>
Oft sacrificing Bullock, Lamb, or Kid,<br/>
With large Wine-offerings pour’d, and sacred Feast<br/>
Shal spend thir dayes in joy unblam’d, and dwell<br/>
Long time in peace by Families and Tribes<br/>
Under paternal rule; till one shall rise<br/>
Of proud ambitious heart, who not content<br/>
With fair equalitie, fraternal state,<br/>
Will arrogate Dominion undeserv’d<br/>
Over his brethren, and quite dispossess<br/>
Concord and law of Nature from the Earth;<br/>
Hunting (and Men not Beasts shall be his game)<br/>
With Warr and hostile snare such as refuse<br/>
Subjection to his Empire tyrannous:<br/>
A mightie Hunter thence he shall be styl’d<br/>
Before the Lord, as in despite of Heav’n,<br/>
Or from Heav’n claming second Sovrantie;<br/>
And from Rebellion shall derive his name,<br/>
Though of Rebellion others he accuse.<br/>
Hee with a crew, whom like Ambition joyns<br/>
With him or under him to tyrannize,<br/>
Marching from <i>Eden</i> towards the West, shall finde<br/>
The Plain, wherein a black bituminous gurge<br/>
Boiles out from under ground, the mouth of Hell;<br/>
Of Brick, and of that stuff they cast to build<br/>
A Citie &amp; Towre, whose top may reach to Heav’n;<br/>
And get themselves a name, least far disperst<br/>
In foraign Lands thir memorie be lost,<br/>
Regardless whether good or evil fame.<br/>
But God who oft descends to visit men<br/>
Unseen, and through thir habitations walks<br/>
To mark thir doings, them beholding soon,<br/>
Comes down to see thir Citie, ere the Tower<br/>
Obstruct Heav’n Towrs, and in derision sets<br/>
Upon thir Tongues a various Spirit to rase<br/>
Quite out thir Native Language, and instead<br/>
To sow a jangling noise of words unknown:<br/>
Forthwith a hideous gabble rises loud<br/>
Among the Builders; each to other calls<br/>
Not understood, till hoarse, and all in rage,<br/>
As mockt they storm; great laughter was in Heav’n<br/>
And looking down, to see the hubbub strange<br/>
And hear the din; thus was the building left<br/>
Ridiculous, and the work Confusion nam’d.<br/>
</p>
				<p class="poem">Whereto thus <i>Adam</i> fatherly displeas’d.<br/>
O execrable Son so to aspire<br/>
Above his Brethren, to himself affirming<br/>
Authoritie usurpt, from God not giv’n:<br/>
He gave us onely over Beast, Fish, Fowl<br/>
Dominion absolute; that right we hold<br/>
By his donation; but Man over men<br/>
He made not Lord; such title to himself<br/>
Reserving, human left from human free.<br/>
But this Usurper his encroachment proud<br/>
Stayes not on Man; to God his Tower intends<br/>
Siege and defiance: Wretched man! what food<br/>
Will he convey up thither to sustain<br/>
Himself and his rash Armie, where thin Aire<br/>
Above the Clouds will pine his entrails gross,<br/>
And famish him of Breath, if not of Bread?<br/>

				<p class="poem">To whom thus <i>Michael</i>.  Justly thou abhorr’st<br/>
That Son, who on the quiet state of men<br/>
Such trouble brought, affecting to subdue<br/>
Rational Libertie; yet know withall,<br/>

Is lost, which alwayes with right Reason dwells<br/>
Twinn’d, and from her hath no dividual being:<br/>
Reason in man obscur’d, or not obeyd,<br/>
Immediately inordinate desires<br/>
And upstart Passions catch the Government<br/>
From Reason, and to servitude reduce<br/>
Man till then free.  Therefore since hee permits<br/>
Within himself unworthie Powers to reign<br/>
Over free Reason, God in Judgement just<br/>
Subjects him from without to violent Lords;<br/>
Who oft as undeservedly enthrall<br/>
His outward freedom: Tyrannie must be,<br/>
Though to the Tyrant thereby no excuse.<br/>
Yet somtimes Nations will decline so low<br/>
From vertue, which is reason, that no wrong,<br/>
But Justice, and some fatal curse annext<br/>
Deprives them of thir outward libertie,<br/>
Thir inward lost: Witness th’ irreverent Son<br/>
Of him who built the Ark, who for the shame<br/>
Don to his Father, heard this heavie curse,<br/>

Thus will this latter, as the former World,<br/>
Still tend from bad to worse, till God at last<br/>
Wearied with their iniquities, withdraw<br/>
His presence from among them, and avert<br/>
His holy Eyes; resolving from thenceforth<br/>
To leave them to thir own polluted wayes;<br/>
And one peculiar Nation to select<br/>
From all the rest, of whom to be invok’d,<br/>
A Nation from one faithful man to spring:<br/>
Him on this side <i>Euphrates</i> yet residing,<br/>
Bred up in Idol-worship; O that men<br/>
(Canst thou believe?) should be so stupid grown,<br/>
While yet the Patriark liv’d, who scap’d the Flood,<br/>
As to forsake the living God, and fall<br/>
To-worship thir own work in Wood and Stone<br/>
For Gods! yet him God the most High voutsafes<br/>
To call by Vision from his Fathers house,<br/>
His kindred and false Gods, into a Land<br/>
Which he will shew him, and from him will raise<br/>
A mightie Nation, and upon him showre<br/>
His benediction so, that in his Seed<br/>
All Nations shall be blest; hee straight obeys,<br/>
Not knowing to what Land, yet firm believes:<br/>
I see him, but thou canst not, with what Faith<br/>
He leaves his Gods, his Friends, and native Soile<br/>
<i>Ur</i> of <i>Chaldaea</i>, passing now the Ford<br/>
To <i>Haran</i>, after him a cumbrous Train<br/>
Of Herds and Flocks, and numerous servitude;<br/>
Not wandring poor, but trusting all his wealth<br/>
With God, who call’d him, in a land unknown.<br/>
<i>Canaan</i> he now attains, I see his Tents<br/>
Pitcht about <i>Sechem</i>, and the neighbouring Plaine<br/>
Of <i>Moreb</i> there by promise he receaves<br/>
Gift to his Progenie of all that Land;<br/>
From <i>Hamath</i> Northward to the Desert South<br/>
(Things by thir names I call, though yet unnam’d)<br/>
From <i>Hermon</i> East to the great Western Sea,<br/>
Mount <i>Hermon</i>, yonder Sea, each place behold<br/>
In prospect, as I point them; on the shoare<br/>
Mount <i>Carmel</i>; here the double-founted stream<br/>
<i>Jordan</i>, true limit Eastward; but his Sons<br/>
Shall dwell to <i>Senir</i>, that long ridge of Hills.<br/>
This ponder, that all Nations of the Earth<br/>
Shall in his Seed be blessed; by that Seed<br/>
Is meant thy great deliverer, who shall bruise<br/>
The Serpents head; whereof to thee anon<br/>
Plainlier shall be reveald.  This Patriarch blest,<br/>
Whom <i>Faithful Abraham</i> due time shall call,<br/>
A Son, and of his Son a Grand-childe leaves,<br/>
Like him in faith, in wisdom, and renown;<br/>
The Grandchilde with twelve Sons increast, departs<br/>
From <i>Canaan</i>, to a Land hereafter call’d<br/>
<i>Egypt</i>, divided by the River <i>Nile</i>;<br/>
See where it flows, disgorging at seaven mouthes<br/>
Into the Sea: to sojourn in that Land<br/>
He comes invited by a yonger Son<br/>
In time of dearth, a Son whose worthy deeds<br/>
Raise him to be the second in that Realme<br/>
Of <i>Pharao</i>: there he dies, and leaves his Race<br/>
Growing into a Nation, and now grown<br/>
Suspected to a sequent King, who seeks<br/>
To stop thir overgrowth, as inmate guests<br/>
Too numerous; whence of guests he makes them slaves<br/>
Inhospitably, and kills thir infant Males:<br/>
Till by two brethren (those two brethren call<br/>
<i>Moses</i> and <i>Aaron</i>) sent from God to claime<br/>
His people from enthralment, they return<br/>
With glory and spoile back to thir promis’d Land.<br/>
But first the lawless Tyrant, who denies<br/>
To know thir God, or message to regard,<br/>
Must be compelld by Signes and Judgements dire;<br/>
To blood unshed the Rivers must be turnd,<br/>
Frogs, Lice and Flies must all his Palace fill<br/>
With loath’d intrusion, and fill all the land;<br/>
His Cattel must of Rot and Murren die,<br/>
Botches and blaines must all his flesh imboss,<br/>
And all his people; Thunder mixt with Haile,<br/>
Haile mixt with fire must rend th’ <i>Egyptian</i> Skie<br/>
And wheel on th’ Earth, devouring where it rouls;<br/>
What it devours not, Herb, or Fruit, or Graine,<br/>
A darksom Cloud of Locusts swarming down<br/>
Must eat, and on the ground leave nothing green:<br/>
Darkness must overshadow all his bounds,<br/>
Palpable darkness, and blot out three dayes;<br/>
Last with one midnight stroke all the first-born<br/>
Of <i>Egypt</i> must lie dead.  Thus with ten wounds<br/>
This River-dragon tam’d at length submits<br/>
To let his sojourners depart, and oft<br/>
Humbles his stubborn heart, but still as Ice<br/>
More hard’nd after thaw, till in his rage<br/>
Pursuing whom he late dismissd, the Sea<br/>
Swallows him with his Host, but them lets pass<br/>
As on drie land between two christal walls,<br/>
Aw’d by the rod of <i>Moses</i> so to stand<br/>
Divided, till his rescu’d gain thir shoar:<br/>
Such wondrous power God to his Saint will lend,<br/>
Though present in his Angel, who shall goe<br/>
Before them in a Cloud, and Pillar of Fire,<br/>
To guide them in thir journey, and remove<br/>
Behinde them, while th’ obdurat King pursues:<br/>
All night he will pursue, but his approach<br/>
Darkness defends between till morning Watch;<br/>
Then through the Firey Pillar and the Cloud<br/>
God looking forth will trouble all his Host<br/>
And craze thir Chariot wheels: when by command<br/>
<i>Moses</i> once more his potent Rod extends<br/>
Over the Sea; the Sea his Rod obeys;<br/>
On thir imbattelld ranks the Waves return,<br/>
And overwhelm thir Warr: the Race elect<br/>
Safe towards <i>Canaan</i> from the shoar advance<br/>
Through the wilde Desert, not the readiest way,<br/>
Least entring on the <i>Canaanite</i> allarmd<br/>
Warr terrifie them inexpert, and feare<br/>
Return them back to <i>Egypt</i>, choosing rather<br/>
Inglorious life with servitude; for life<br/>
To noble and ignoble is more sweet<br/>
Untraind in Armes, where rashness leads not on.<br/>
This also shall they gain by thir delay<br/>
In the wide Wilderness, there they shall found<br/>
Thir government, and thir great Senate choose<br/>
Through the twelve Tribes, to rule by Laws ordaind:<br/>
God from the Mount of <i>Sinai</i>, whose gray top<br/>
Shall tremble, he descending, will himself<br/>
In Thunder Lightning and loud Trumpets sound<br/>
Ordaine them Lawes; part such as appertaine<br/>
To civil Justice, part religious Rites<br/>
Of sacrifice, informing them, by types<br/>
And shadowes, of that destind Seed to bruise<br/>
The Serpent, by what meanes he shall achieve<br/>
Mankinds deliverance.  But the voice of God<br/>
To mortal eare is dreadful; they beseech<br/>
That <i>Moses</i> might report to them his will,<br/>
And terror cease; he grants them thir desire,<br/>
Instructed that to God is no access<br/>
Without Mediator, whose high Office now<br/>
<i>Moses</i> in figure beares, to introduce<br/>
One greater, of whose day he shall foretell,<br/>
And all the Prophets in thir Age the times<br/>
Of great <i>Messiah</i> shall sing.  Thus Laws and Rites<br/>
Establisht, such delight hath God in Men<br/>
Obedient to his will, that he voutsafes<br/>
Among them to set up his Tabernacle,<br/>
The holy One with mortal Men to dwell:<br/>
By his prescript a Sanctuary is fram’d<br/>
Of Cedar, overlaid with Gold, therein<br/>
An Ark, and in the Ark his Testimony,<br/>
The Records of his Cov’nant, over these<br/>
A Mercie-seat of Gold between the wings<br/>
Of two bright Cherubim, before him burn<br/>
Seaven Lamps as in a Zodiac representing<br/>
The Heav’nly fires; over the Tent a Cloud<br/>
Shall rest by Day, a fierie gleame by Night,<br/>
Save when they journie, and at length they come,<br/>
Conducted by his Angel to the Land<br/>
Promisd to <i>Abraham</i> and his Seed: the rest<br/>
Were long to tell, how many Battels fought,<br/>
How many Kings destroyd, and Kingdoms won,<br/>
Or how the Sun shall in mid Heav’n stand still<br/>
A day entire, and Nights due course adjourne,<br/>
Mans voice commanding, Sun in <i>Gibeon</i> stand,<br/>
And thou Moon in the vale of <i>Aialon</i>,<br/>
Till <i>Israel</i> overcome; so call the third<br/>
From <i>Abraham</i>, Son of <i>Isaac</i>, and from him<br/>
His whole descent, who thus shall <i>Canaan</i> win.<br/>
</p>
				<p class="poem">Here <i>Adam</i> interpos’d.  O sent from Heav’n,<br/>
Enlightner of my darkness, gracious things<br/>
Thou hast reveald, those chiefly which concerne<br/>
Just <i>Abraham</i> and his Seed: now first I finde<br/>
Mine eyes true op’ning, and my heart much eas’d,<br/>
Erwhile perplext with thoughts what would becom<br/>
Of mee and all Mankind; but now I see<br/>
His day, in whom all Nations shall be blest,<br/>
Favour unmerited by me, who sought<br/>
Forbidd’n knowledge by forbidd’n means.<br/>
This yet I apprehend not, why to those<br/>
Among whom God will deigne to dwell on Earth<br/>
So many and so various Laws are giv’n;<br/>
So many Laws argue so many sins<br/>
Among them; how can God with such reside?<br/>
</p>
				<p class="poem">To whom thus <i>Michael</i>.  Doubt not but that sin<br/>
Will reign among them, as of thee begot;<br/>
And therefore was Law given them to evince<br/>
Thir natural pravitie, by stirring up<br/>
Sin against Law to fight; that when they see<br/>
Law can discover sin, but not remove,<br/>
Save by those shadowie expiations weak,<br/>
The bloud of Bulls and Goats, they may conclude<br/>
Some bloud more precious must be paid for Man,<br/>
Just for unjust, that in such righteousness<br/>
To them by Faith imputed, they may finde<br/>
Justification towards God, and peace<br/>
Of Conscience, which the Law by Ceremonies<br/>
Cannot appease, nor Man the moral part<br/>
Perform, and not performing cannot live.<br/>
So Law appears imperfet, and but giv’n<br/>
With purpose to resign them in full time<br/>
Up to a better Cov’nant, disciplin’d<br/>
From shadowie Types to Truth, from Flesh to Spirit,<br/>
From imposition of strict Laws, to free<br/>
Acceptance of large Grace, from servil fear<br/>
To filial, works of Law to works of Faith.<br/>
And therefore shall not <i>Moses</i>, though of God<br/>
Highly belov’d, being but the Minister<br/>
Of Law, his people into <i>Canaan</i> lead;<br/>
But <i>Joshua</i> whom the Gentiles <i>Jesus</i> call,<br/>
His Name and Office bearing, who shall quell<br/>
The adversarie Serpent, and bring back<br/>
Through the worlds wilderness long wanderd man<br/>
Safe to eternal Paradise of rest.<br/>
Meanwhile they in thir earthly <i>Canaan</i> plac’t<br/>
Long time shall dwell and prosper, but when sins<br/>
National interrupt thir public peace,<br/>
Provoking God to raise them enemies:<br/>
From whom as oft he saves them penitent<br/>
By Judges first, then under Kings; of whom<br/>
The second, both for pietie renownd<br/>
And puissant deeds, a promise shall receive<br/>
Irrevocable, that his Regal Throne<br/>
For ever shall endure; the like shall sing<br/>
All Prophecie, That of the Royal Stock<br/>
Of <i>David</i> (so I name this King) shall rise<br/>
A Son, the Womans Seed to thee foretold,<br/>
Foretold to <i>Abraham</i>, as in whom shall trust<br/>
All Nations, and to Kings foretold, of Kings<br/>
The last, for of his Reign shall be no end.<br/>
But first a long succession must ensue,<br/>
And his next Son for Wealth and Wisdom fam’d,<br/>
The clouded Ark of God till then in Tents<br/>
Wandring, shall in a glorious Temple enshrine.<br/>
Such follow him, as shall be registerd<br/>
Part good, part bad, of bad the longer scrowle,<br/>
Whose foul Idolatries, and other faults<br/>
Heapt to the popular summe, will so incense<br/>
God, as to leave them, and expose thir Land,<br/>
Thir Citie, his Temple, and his holy Ark<br/>
With all his sacred things, a scorn and prey<br/>
To that proud Citie, whose high Walls thou saw’st<br/>
Left in confusion, <i>Babylon</i> thence call’d.<br/>
There in captivitie he lets them dwell<br/>
The space of seventie years, then brings them back,<br/>
Remembring mercie, and his Cov’nant sworn<br/>
To <i>David</i>, stablisht as the dayes of Heav’n.<br/>
Returnd from <i>Babylon</i> by leave of Kings<br/>
Thir Lords, whom God dispos’d, the house of God<br/>
They first re-edifie, and for a while<br/>
In mean estate live moderate, till grown<br/>
In wealth and multitude, factious they grow;<br/>
But first among the Priests dissension springs,<br/>
Men who attend the Altar, and should most<br/>
Endeavour Peace: thir strife pollution brings<br/>
Upon the Temple it self: at last they seise<br/>
The Scepter, and regard not <i>Davids</i> Sons,<br/>
Then loose it to a stranger, that the true<br/>
Anointed King <i>Messiah</i> might be born<br/>
Barr’d of his right; yet at his Birth a Starr<br/>
Unseen before in Heav’n proclaims him com,<br/>
And guides the Eastern Sages, who enquire<br/>
His place, to offer Incense, Myrrh, and Gold;<br/>
His place of birth a solemn Angel tells<br/>
To simple Shepherds, keeping watch by night;<br/>
They gladly thither haste, and by a Quire<br/>
Of squadrond Angels hear his Carol sung.<br/>
A Virgin is his Mother, but his Sire<br/>
The Power of the most High; he shall ascend<br/>
The Throne hereditarie, and bound his Reign<br/>
With earths wide bounds, his glory with the Heav’ns.<br/>
</p>
				<p class="poem">He ceas’d, discerning <i>Adam</i> with such joy<br/>
Surcharg’d, as had like grief bin dew’d in tears,<br/>
Without the vent of words, which these he breathd.<br/>
</p>
				<p class="poem">O Prophet of glad tidings, finisher<br/>
Of utmost hope! now clear I understand<br/>
What oft my steddiest thoughts have searcht in vain,<br/>
Why our great expectation should be call’d<br/>
The seed of Woman: Virgin Mother, Haile,<br/>
High in the love of Heav’n, yet from my Loynes<br/>
Thou shalt proceed, and from thy Womb the Son<br/>
Of God most High; So God with man unites.<br/>
Needs must the Serpent now his capital bruise<br/>
Expect with mortal paine: say where and when<br/>
Thir fight, what stroke shall bruise the Victors heel.<br/>
</p>
				<p class="poem">To whom thus <i>Michael</i>.  Dream not of thir fight,<br/>
As of a Duel, or the local wounds<br/>
Of head or heel: not therefore joynes the Son<br/>
Manhood to God-head, with more strength to foil<br/>
Thy enemie; nor so is overcome<br/>
<i>Satan</i>, whose fall from Heav’n, a deadlier bruise,<br/>
Disabl’d not to give thee thy deaths wound:<br/>
Which hee, who comes thy Saviour, shall recure,<br/>
Not by destroying <i>Satan</i>, but his works<br/>
In thee and in thy Seed: nor can this be,<br/>
But by fulfilling that which thou didst want,<br/>
Obedience to the Law of God, impos’d<br/>
On penaltie of death, and suffering death,<br/>
The penaltie to thy transgression due,<br/>
And due to theirs which out of thine will grow:<br/>
So onely can high Justice rest appaid.<br/>
The Law of God exact he shall fulfill<br/>
Both by obedience and by love, though love<br/>
Alone fulfill the Law; thy punishment<br/>
He shall endure by coming in the Flesh<br/>
To a reproachful life and cursed death,<br/>
Proclaiming Life to all who shall believe<br/>
In his redemption, and that his obedience<br/>
Imputed becomes theirs by Faith, his merits<br/>
To save them, not thir own, though legal works.<br/>
For this he shall live hated, be blasphem’d,<br/>
Seis’d on by force, judg’d, and to death condemnd<br/>
A shameful and accurst, naild to the Cross<br/>
By his own Nation, slaine for bringing Life;<br/>
But to the Cross he nailes thy Enemies,<br/>
The Law that is against thee, and the sins<br/>
Of all mankinde, with him there crucifi’d,<br/>
Never to hurt them more who rightly trust<br/>
In this his satisfaction; so he dies,<br/>
But soon revives, Death over him no power<br/>
Shall long usurp; ere the third dawning light<br/>
Returne, the Starres of Morn shall see him rise<br/>
Out of his grave, fresh as the dawning light,<br/>
Thy ransom paid, which Man from death redeems,<br/>
His death for Man, as many as offerd Life<br/>
Neglect not, and the benefit imbrace<br/>
By Faith not void of works: this God-like act<br/>
Annuls thy doom, the death thou shouldst have dy’d,<br/>
In sin for ever lost from life; this act<br/>
Shall bruise the head of <i>Satan</i>, crush his strength<br/>
Defeating Sin and Death, his two maine armes,<br/>
And fix farr deeper in his head thir stings<br/>
Then temporal death shall bruise the Victors heel,<br/>
Or theirs whom he redeems, a death like sleep,<br/>
A gentle wafting to immortal Life.<br/>
Nor after resurrection shall he stay<br/>
Longer on Earth then certaine times to appeer<br/>
To his Disciples, Men who in his Life<br/>
Still follow’d him; to them shall leave in charge<br/>
To teach all nations what of him they learn’d<br/>
And his Salvation, them who shall beleeve<br/>
Baptizing in the profluent streame, the signe<br/>
Of washing them from guilt of sin to Life<br/>
Pure, and in mind prepar’d, if so befall,<br/>
For death, like that which the redeemer dy’d.<br/>
All Nations they shall teach; for from that day<br/>
Not onely to the Sons of <i>Abrahams</i> Loines<br/>
Salvation shall be Preacht, but to the Sons<br/>
Of <i>Abrahams</i> Faith wherever through the world;<br/>
So in his seed all Nations shall be blest.<br/>
Then to the Heav’n of Heav’ns he shall ascend<br/>
With victory, triumphing through the aire<br/>
Over his foes and thine; there shall surprise<br/>
The Serpent, Prince of aire, and drag in Chaines<br/>
Through all his realme, &amp; there confounded leave;<br/>
Then enter into glory, and resume<br/>
His Seat at Gods right hand, exalted high<br/>
Above all names in Heav’n; and thence shall come,<br/>
When this worlds dissolution shall be ripe,<br/>
With glory and power to judge both quick &amp; dead,<br/>
To judge th’ unfaithful dead, but to reward<br/>
His faithful, and receave them into bliss,<br/>
Whether in Heav’n or Earth, for then the Earth<br/>
Shall all be Paradise, far happier place<br/>
Then this of <i>Eden</i>, and far happier daies.<br/>
</p>
				<p class="poem">So spake th’ Archangel <i>Michael</i>, then paus’d,<br/>
As at the Worlds great period; and our Sire<br/>
Replete with joy and wonder thus repli’d.<br/>
</p>
				<p class="poem">O goodness infinite, goodness immense!<br/>
That all this good of evil shall produce,<br/>
And evil turn to good; more wonderful<br/>
Then that which by creation first brought forth<br/>
Light out of darkness! full of doubt I stand,<br/>
Whether I should repent me now of sin<br/>
By mee done and occasiond, or rejoyce<br/>
Much more, that much more good thereof shall spring,<br/>
To God more glory, more good will to Men<br/>
From God, and over wrauth grace shall abound.<br/>
But say, if our deliverer up to Heav’n<br/>
Must reascend, what will betide the few<br/>
His faithful, left among th’ unfaithful herd,<br/>
The enemies of truth; who then shall guide<br/>
His people, who defend? will they not deale<br/>
Wors with his followers then with him they dealt?<br/>
</p>
				<p class="poem">Be sure they will, said th’ Angel; but from Heav’n<br/>
Hee to his own a Comforter will send,<br/>
The promise of the Father, who shall dwell<br/>
His Spirit within them, and the Law of Faith<br/>
Working through love, upon thir hearts shall write,<br/>
To guide them in all truth, and also arme<br/>
With spiritual Armour, able to resist<br/>
<i>Satans</i> assaults, and quench his fierie darts<br/>
What Man can do against them, not affraid,<br/>
Though to the death, against such cruelties<br/>
With inward consolations recompenc’t,<br/>
And oft supported so as shall amaze<br/>
Thir proudest persecuters: for the Spirit<br/>
Powrd first on his Apostles, whom he sends<br/>
To evangelize the Nations, then on all<br/>
Baptiz’d, shall them with wondrous gifts endue<br/>
To speak all Tongues, and do all Miracles,<br/>
As did thir Lord before them.  Thus they win<br/>
Great numbers of each Nation to receave<br/>
With joy the tidings brought from Heav’n: at length<br/>
Thir Ministry perform’d, and race well run,<br/>
Thir doctrine and thir story written left,<br/>
They die; but in thir room, as they forewarne,<br/>
Wolves shall succeed for teachers, grievous Wolves,<br/>
Who all the sacred mysteries of Heav’n<br/>
To thir own vile advantages shall turne<br/>
Of lucre and ambition, and the truth<br/>
With superstitions and traditions taint,<br/>
Left onely in those written Records pure,<br/>
Though not but by the Spirit understood.<br/>
Then shall they seek to avail themselves of names,<br/>
Places and titles, and with these to joine<br/>
Secular power, though feigning still to act<br/>
By spiritual, to themselves appropriating<br/>
The Spirit of God, promisd alike and giv’n<br/>
To all Beleevers; and from that pretense,<br/>
Spiritual Lawes by carnal power shall force<br/>
On every conscience; Laws which none shall finde<br/>
Left them inrould, or what the Spirit within<br/>
Shall on the heart engrave.  What will they then<br/>
But force the Spirit of Grace it self, and binde<br/>
His consort Libertie; what, but unbuild<br/>
His living Temples, built by Faith to stand,<br/>
Thir own Faith not anothers: for on Earth<br/>
Who against Faith and Conscience can be heard<br/>
Infallible? yet many will presume:<br/>
Whence heavie persecution shall arise<br/>
On all who in the worship persevere<br/>
Of Spirit and Truth; the rest, farr greater part,<br/>
Will deem in outward Rites and specious formes<br/>
Religion satisfi’d; Truth shall retire<br/>
Bestuck with slandrous darts, and works of Faith<br/>
Rarely be found: so shall the World goe on,<br/>
To good malignant, to bad men benigne,<br/>
Under her own waight groaning, till the day<br/>
Appeer of respiration to the just,<br/>
And vengeance to the wicked, at return<br/>
Of him so lately promis’d to thy aid,<br/>
The Womans seed, obscurely then foretold,<br/>
Now amplier known thy Saviour and thy Lord,<br/>
Last in the Clouds from Heav’n to be reveald<br/>
In glory of the Father, to dissolve<br/>
<i>Satan</i> with his perverted World, then raise<br/>
From the conflagrant mass, purg’d and refin’d,<br/>
New Heav’ns, new Earth, Ages of endless date<br/>
Founded in righteousness and peace and love,<br/>
To bring forth fruits Joy and eternal Bliss.<br/>
</p>
				<p class="poem">He ended; and thus <i>Adam</i> last reply’d.<br/>
How soon hath thy prediction, Seer blest,<br/>
Measur’d this transient World, the Race of time,<br/>
Till time stand fixt: beyond is all abyss,<br/>
Eternitie, whose end no eye can reach.<br/>
Greatly instructed I shall hence depart,<br/>
Greatly in peace of thought, and have my fill<br/>
Of knowledge, what this vessel can containe;<br/>
Beyond which was my folly to aspire.<br/>
Henceforth I learne, that to obey is best,<br/>
And love with feare the onely God, to walk<br/>
As in his presence, ever to observe<br/>
His providence, and on him sole depend,<br/>
Merciful over all his works, with good<br/>
Still overcoming evil, and by small<br/>
Accomplishing great things, by things deemd weak<br/>
Subverting worldly strong, and worldly wise<br/>
By simply meek; that suffering for Truths sake<br/>
Is fortitude to highest victorie,<br/>
And to the faithful Death the Gate of Life;<br/>
Taught this by his example whom I now<br/>
Acknowledge my Redeemer ever blest.<br/>
</p>
				<p class="poem">To whom thus also th’ Angel last repli’d:<br/>
This having learnt, thou hast attaind the summe<br/>

All secrets of the deep, all Natures works,<br/>
Or works of God in Heav’n, Air, Earth, or Sea,<br/>
And all the riches of this World enjoydst,<br/>
And all the rule, one Empire; onely add<br/>
Deeds to thy knowledge answerable, add Faith,<br/>
Add Vertue, Patience, Temperance, add Love,<br/>
By name to come call’d Charitie, the soul<br/>
Of all the rest: then wilt thou not be loath<br/>
To leave this Paradise, but shalt possess<br/>
A Paradise within thee, happier farr.<br/>
Let us descend now therefore from this top<br/>
Of Speculation; for the hour precise<br/>
Exacts our parting hence; and see the Guards,<br/>
By mee encampt on yonder Hill, expect<br/>
Thir motion, at whose Front a flaming Sword,<br/>
In signal of remove, waves fiercely round;<br/>
We may no longer stay: go, waken Eve;<br/>
Her also I with gentle Dreams have calm’d<br/>
Portending good, and all her spirits compos’d<br/>
To meek submission: thou at season fit<br/>
Let her with thee partake what thou hast heard,<br/>
Chiefly what may concern her Faith to know,<br/>
The great deliverance by her Seed to come<br/>
(For by the Womans Seed) on all Mankind.<br/>
That ye may live, which will be many dayes,<br/>
Both in one Faith unanimous though sad,<br/>
With cause for evils past, yet much more cheer’d<br/>
With meditation on the happie end.<br/>
</p>
				<p class="poem">He ended, and they both descend the Hill;<br/>
Descended, <i>Adam</i> to the Bowre where <i>Eve</i><br/>
Lay sleeping ran before, but found her wak’t;<br/>
And thus with words not sad she him receav’d.<br/>
</p>
				<p class="poem">Whence thou returnst, &amp; whither wentst, I know;<br/>
For God is also in sleep, and Dreams advise,<br/>
Which he hath sent propitious, some great good<br/>
Presaging, since with sorrow and hearts distress<br/>
VVearied I fell asleep: but now lead on;<br/>
In mee is no delay; with thee to goe,<br/>
Is to stay here; without thee here to stay,<br/>
Is to go hence unwilling; thou to mee<br/>
Art all things under Heav’n, all places thou,<br/>
VVho for my wilful crime art banisht hence.<br/>
This further consolation yet secure<br/>
I carry hence; though all by mee is lost,<br/>
Such favour I unworthie am voutsaft,<br/>
By mee the Promis’d Seed shall all restore.<br/>
</p>
				<p class="poem">So spake our Mother <i>Eve</i>, and <i>Adam</i> heard<br/>
VVell pleas’d, but answer’d not; for now too nigh<br/>
Th’ Archangel stood, and from the other Hill<br/>
To thir fixt Station, all in bright array<br/>
The Cherubim descended; on the ground<br/>
Gliding meteorous, as Ev’ning Mist<br/>
Ris’n from a River o’re the marish glides,<br/>
And gathers ground fast at the Labourers heel<br/>
Homeward returning.  High in Front advanc’t,<br/>
The brandisht Sword of God before them blaz’d<br/>
Fierce as a Comet; which with torrid heat,<br/>
And vapour as the <i>Libyan</i> Air adust,<br/>
Began to parch that temperate Clime; whereat<br/>
In either hand the hastning Angel caught<br/>
Our lingring Parents, and to th’ Eastern Gate<br/>
Let them direct, and down the Cliff as fast<br/>
To the subjected Plaine; then disappeer’d.<br/>
They looking back, all th’ Eastern side beheld<br/>
Of Paradise, so late thir happie seat,<br/>
Wav’d over by that flaming Brand, the Gate<br/>
With dreadful Faces throng’d and fierie Armes:<br/>
Som natural tears they drop’d, but wip’d them soon;<br/>
The World was all before them, where to choose<br/>
Thir place of rest, and Providence thir guide:<br/>
They hand in hand with wandring steps and slow,<br/>
Through <i>Eden</i> took thir solitarie way.<br/>
