				<p class="pfirst">Hail holy light, ofspring of Heav’n first-born,<br/>
Or of th’ Eternal Coeternal beam<br/>
May I express thee unblam’d? since God is light,<br/>
And never but in unapproached light<br/>
Dwelt from Eternitie, dwelt then in thee,<br/>
Bright effluence of bright essence increate.<br/>
Or hear’st thou rather pure Ethereal stream,<br/>
Whose Fountain who shall tell? before the Sun,<br/>
Before the Heavens thou wert, and at the voice<br/>
Of God, as with a Mantle didst invest<br/>
The rising world of waters dark and deep,<br/>
Won from the void and formless infinite.<br/>
Thee I re-visit now with bolder wing,<br/>
Escap’t the <i>Stygian</i> Pool, though long detain’d<br/>
In that obscure sojourn, while in my flight<br/>
Through utter and through middle darkness borne<br/>
With other notes then to th’ <i>Orphean</i> Lyre<br/>
I sung of <i>Chaos</i> and <i>Eternal Night</i>,<br/>
Taught by the heav’nly Muse to venture down<br/>
The dark descent, and up to reascend,<br/>
Though hard and rare: thee I revisit safe,<br/>
And feel thy sovran vital Lamp; but thou<br/>
Revisit’st not these eyes, that rowle in vain<br/>
To find thy piercing ray, and find no dawn;<br/>
So thick a drop serene hath quencht thir Orbs,<br/>
Or dim suffusion veild.  Yet not the more<br/>
Cease I to wander where the Muses haunt<br/>
Cleer Spring, or shadie Grove, or Sunnie Hill,<br/>
Smit with the love of sacred song; but chief<br/>
Thee <i>Sion</i> and the flowrie Brooks beneath<br/>
That wash thy hallowd feet, and warbling flow,<br/>
Nightly I visit: nor somtimes forget<br/>
Those other two equal’d with me in Fate,<br/>
So were I equal’d with them in renown,<br/>
Blind <i>Thamyris</i> and blind <i>Maeonides</i>,<br/>
And <i>Tiresias</i> and <i>Phineus</i> Prophets old.<br/>
Then feed on thoughts, that voluntarie move<br/>
Harmonious numbers; as the wakeful Bird<br/>
Sings darkling, and in shadiest Covert hid<br/>
Tunes her nocturnal Note.  Thus with the Year<br/>
Seasons return, but not to me returns<br/>
Day, or the sweet approach of Ev’n or Morn,<br/>
Or sight of vernal bloom, or Summers Rose,<br/>
Or flocks, or herds, or human face divine;<br/>
But cloud in stead, and ever-during dark<br/>
Surrounds me, from the chearful waies of men<br/>
Cut off, and for the book of knowledg fair<br/>
Presented with a Universal blanc<br/>
Of Natures works to mee expung’d and ras’d,<br/>
And wisdome at one entrance quite shut out.<br/>
So much the rather thou Celestial light<br/>
Shine inward, and the mind through all her powers<br/>
Irradiate, there plant eyes, all mist from thence<br/>
Purge and disperse, that I may see and tell<br/>
Of things invisible to mortal sight.<br/>
</p>
				<p class="poem">Now had the Almighty Father from above,<br/>
From the pure Empyrean where he sits<br/>
High Thron’d above all highth, bent down his eye,<br/>
His own works and their works at once to view:<br/>
About him all the Sanctities of Heaven<br/>
Stood thick as Starrs, and from his sight receiv’d<br/>
Beatitude past utterance; on his right<br/>
The radiant image of his Glory sat,<br/>
His onely Son; On Earth he first beheld<br/>
Our two first Parents, yet the onely two<br/>
Of mankind, in the happie Garden plac’t,<br/>
Reaping immortal fruits of joy and love,<br/>
Uninterrupted joy, unrivald love<br/>
In blissful solitude; he then survey’d<br/>
Hell and the Gulf between, and <i>Satan</i> there<br/>
Coasting the wall of Heav’n on this side Night<br/>
In the dun Air sublime, and ready now<br/>
To stoop with wearied wings, and willing feet<br/>
On the bare outside of this World, that seem’d<br/>
Firm land imbosom’d without Firmament,<br/>
Uncertain which, in Ocean or in Air.<br/>
Him God beholding from his prospect high,<br/>
Wherein past, present, future he beholds,<br/>
Thus to his onely Son foreseeing spake.<br/>
</p>
				<p class="poem">Onely begotten Son, seest thou what rage<br/>
Transports our adversarie, whom no bounds<br/>
Prescrib’d, no barrs of Hell, nor all the chains<br/>
Heapt on him there, nor yet the main Abyss<br/>
Wide interrupt can hold; so bent he seems<br/>
On desperat revenge, that shall redound<br/>
Upon his own rebellious head.  And now<br/>
Through all restraint broke loose he wings his way<br/>
Not farr off Heav’n, in the Precincts of light,<br/>
Directly towards the new created World,<br/>
And Man there plac’t, with purpose to assay<br/>
If him by force he can destroy, or worse,<br/>
By som false guile pervert; and shall pervert;<br/>
For man will heark’n to his glozing lyes,<br/>
And easily transgress the sole Command,<br/>
Sole pledge of his obedience: So will fall<br/>
Hee and his faithless Progenie: whose fault?<br/>
Whose but his own? ingrate, he had of mee<br/>
All he could have; I made him just and right,<br/>
Sufficient to have stood, though free to fall.<br/>
Such I created all th’ Ethereal Powers<br/>
And Spirits, both them who stood &amp; them who faild;<br/>
Freely they stood who stood, and fell who fell.<br/>
Not free, what proof could they have givn sincere<br/>
Of true allegiance, constant Faith or Love,<br/>
Where onely what they needs must do, appeard,<br/>
Not what they would? what praise could they receive?<br/>
What pleasure I from such obedience paid,<br/>
When Will and Reason (Reason also is choice)<br/>
Useless and vain, of freedom both despoild,<br/>
Made passive both, had servd necessitie,<br/>
Not mee.  They therefore as to right belongd,<br/>
So were created, nor can justly accuse<br/>
Thir maker, or thir making, or thir Fate;<br/>
As if Predestination over-rul’d<br/>
Thir will, dispos’d by absolute Decree<br/>
Or high foreknowledge; they themselves decreed<br/>
Thir own revolt, not I: if I foreknew,<br/>
Foreknowledge had no influence on their fault,<br/>
Which had no less prov’d certain unforeknown.<br/>
So without least impulse or shadow of Fate,<br/>
Or aught by me immutablie foreseen,<br/>
They trespass, Authors to themselves in all<br/>
Both what they judge and what they choose; for so<br/>
I formd them free, and free they must remain,<br/>
Till they enthrall themselves: I else must change<br/>
Thir nature, and revoke the high Decree<br/>
Unchangeable, Eternal, which ordain’d<br/>
Thir freedom, they themselves ordain’d thir fall.<br/>
The first sort by thir own suggestion fell,<br/>
Self-tempted, self-deprav’d: Man falls deceiv’d<br/>
By the other first: Man therefore shall find grace,<br/>
The other none: in Mercy and Justice both,<br/>
Through Heav’n and Earth, so shall my glorie excel,<br/>
But Mercy first and last shall brightest shine.<br/>
</p>
				<p class="poem">Thus while God spake, ambrosial fragrance fill’d<br/>
All Heav’n, and in the blessed Spirits elect<br/>
Sense of new joy ineffable diffus’d:<br/>
Beyond compare the Son of God was seen<br/>
Most glorious, in him all his Father shon<br/>
Substantially express’d, and in his face<br/>
Divine compassion visibly appeerd,<br/>
Love without end, and without measure Grace,<br/>
Which uttering thus he to his Father spake.<br/>
</p>
				<p class="poem">O Father, gracious was that word which clos’d<br/>
Thy sovran sentence, that Man should find grace;<br/>
For which both Heav’n and Earth shall high extoll<br/>
Thy praises, with th’ innumerable sound<br/>
Of Hymns and sacred Songs, wherewith thy Throne<br/>
Encompass’d shall resound thee ever blest.<br/>
For should Man finally be lost, should Man<br/>
Thy creature late so lov’d, thy youngest Son<br/>
Fall circumvented thus by fraud, though joynd<br/>
With his own folly? that be from thee farr,<br/>
That farr be from thee, Father, who art Judge<br/>
Of all things made, and judgest onely right.<br/>
Or shall the Adversarie thus obtain<br/>
His end, and frustrate thine, shall he fulfill<br/>
His malice, and thy goodness bring to naught,<br/>
Or proud return though to his heavier doom,<br/>
Yet with revenge accomplish’t and to Hell<br/>
Draw after him the whole Race of mankind,<br/>
By him corrupted? or wilt thou thy self<br/>
Abolish thy Creation, and unmake,<br/>
For him, what for thy glorie thou hast made?<br/>
So should thy goodness and thy greatness both<br/>
Be questiond and blaspheam’d without defence.<br/>
</p>
				<p class="poem">To whom the great Creatour thus reply’d.<br/>
O Son, in whom my Soul hath chief delight,<br/>
Son of my bosom, Son who art alone<br/>
My word, my wisdom, and effectual might,<br/>
All hast thou spok’n as my thoughts are, all<br/>
As my Eternal purpose hath decreed:<br/>
Man shall not quite be lost, but sav’d who will,<br/>
Yet not of will in him, but grace in me<br/>
Freely voutsaft; once more I will renew<br/>
His lapsed powers, though forfeit and enthrall’d<br/>
By sin to foul exorbitant desires;<br/>
Upheld by me, yet once more he shall stand<br/>
On even ground against his mortal foe,<br/>
By me upheld, that he may know how frail<br/>
His fall’n condition is, and to me ow<br/>
All his deliv’rance, and to none but me.<br/>
Some I have chosen of peculiar grace<br/>
Elect above the rest; so is my will:<br/>
The rest shall hear me call, and oft be warnd<br/>
Thir sinful state, and to appease betimes<br/>
Th’ incensed Deitie, while offerd grace<br/>
Invites; for I will cleer thir senses dark,<br/>
What may suffice, and soft’n stonie hearts<br/>
To pray, repent, and bring obedience due.<br/>
To prayer, repentance, and obedience due,<br/>
Though but endevord with sincere intent,<br/>
Mine eare shall not be slow, mine eye not shut.<br/>
And I will place within them as a guide<br/>
My Umpire <i>Conscience</i>, whom if they will hear,<br/>
Light after light well us’d they shall attain,<br/>
And to the end persisting, safe arrive.<br/>
This my long sufferance and my day of grace<br/>
They who neglect and scorn, shall never taste;<br/>
But hard be hard’nd, blind be blinded more,<br/>
That they may stumble on, and deeper fall;<br/>
And none but such from mercy I exclude.<br/>
But yet all is not don; Man disobeying,<br/>
Disloyal breaks his fealtie, and sinns<br/>
Against the high Supremacie of Heav’n,<br/>
Affecting God-head, and so loosing all,<br/>
To expiate his Treason hath naught left,<br/>
But to destruction sacred and devote,<br/>
He with his whole posteritie must die,<br/>
Die hee or Justice must; unless for him<br/>
Som other able, and as willing, pay<br/>
The rigid satisfaction, death for death.<br/>
Say Heav’nly Powers, where shall we find such love,<br/>
Which of ye will be mortal to redeem<br/>
Mans mortal crime, and just th’ unjust to save,<br/>
Dwels in all Heaven charitie so deare?<br/>
</p>
				<p class="poem">He ask’d, but all the Heav’nly Quire stood mute,<br/>
And silence was in Heav’n: on mans behalf<br/>
Patron or Intercessor none appeerd,<br/>
Much less that durst upon his own head draw<br/>
The deadly forfeiture, and ransom set.<br/>
And now without redemption all mankind<br/>
Must have bin lost, adjudg’d to Death and Hell<br/>
By doom severe, had not the Son of God,<br/>
In whom the fulness dwels of love divine,<br/>
His dearest mediation thus renewd.<br/>
</p>
				<p class="poem">Father, thy word is past, man shall find grace;<br/>
And shall grace not find means, that finds her way,<br/>
The speediest of thy winged messengers,<br/>
To visit all thy creatures, and to all<br/>
Comes unprevented, unimplor’d, unsought,<br/>
Happie for man, so coming; he her aide<br/>
Can never seek, once dead in sins and lost;<br/>
Attonement for himself or offering meet,<br/>
Indebted and undon, hath none to bring:<br/>
Behold mee then, mee for him, life for life<br/>
I offer, on mee let thine anger fall;<br/>
Account mee man; I for his sake will leave<br/>
Thy bosom, and this glorie next to thee<br/>
Freely put off, and for him lastly die<br/>
Well pleas’d, on me let Death wreck all his rage;<br/>
Under his gloomie power I shall not long<br/>
Lie vanquisht; thou hast givn me to possess<br/>
Life in my self for ever, by thee I live,<br/>
Though now to Death I yeild, and am his due<br/>
All that of me can die, yet that debt paid,<br/>
Thou wilt not leave me in the loathsom grave<br/>
His prey, nor suffer my unspotted Soule<br/>
For ever with corruption there to dwell;<br/>
But I shall rise Victorious, and subdue<br/>
My Vanquisher, spoild of his vanted spoile;<br/>
Death his deaths wound shall then receive, &amp; stoop<br/>
Inglorious, of his mortall sting disarm’d.<br/>
I through the ample Air in Triumph high<br/>
Shall lead Hell Captive maugre Hell, and show<br/>
The powers of darkness bound.  Thou at the sight<br/>
Pleas’d, out of Heaven shalt look down and smile,<br/>
While by thee rais’d I ruin all my Foes,<br/>
Death last, and with his Carcass glut the Grave:<br/>
Then with the multitude of my redeemd<br/>
Shall enter Heaven long absent, and returne,<br/>
Father, to see thy face, wherein no cloud<br/>
Of anger shall remain, but peace assur’d,<br/>
And reconcilement; wrauth shall be no more<br/>
Thenceforth, but in thy presence Joy entire.<br/>
</p>
				<p class="poem">His words here ended, but his meek aspect<br/>
Silent yet spake, and breath’d immortal love<br/>
To mortal men, above which only shon<br/>
Filial obedience: as a sacrifice<br/>
Glad to be offer’d, he attends the will<br/>
Of his great Father.  Admiration seis’d<br/>
All Heav’n, what this might mean, &amp; whither tend<br/>
Wondring; but soon th’ Almighty thus reply’d:<br/>
</p>
				<p class="poem">O thou in Heav’n and Earth the only peace<br/>
Found out for mankind under wrauth, O thou<br/>
My sole complacence! well thou know’st how dear,<br/>
To me are all my works, nor Man the least<br/>
Though last created, that for him I spare<br/>
Thee from my bosom and right hand, to save,<br/>
By loosing thee a while, the whole Race lost.<br/>
Thou therefore whom thou only canst redeeme,<br/>
Thir Nature also to thy Nature joyne;<br/>
And be thy self Man among men on Earth,<br/>
Made flesh, when time shall be, of Virgin seed,<br/>
By wondrous birth: Be thou in <i>Adams</i> room<br/>
The Head of all mankind, though <i>Adams</i> Son.<br/>
As in him perish all men, so in thee<br/>
As from a second root shall be restor’d,<br/>
As many as are restor’d, without thee none.<br/>
His crime makes guiltie all his Sons, thy merit<br/>
Imputed shall absolve them who renounce<br/>
Thir own both righteous and unrighteous deeds,<br/>
And live in thee transplanted, and from thee<br/>
Receive new life.  So Man, as is most just,<br/>
Shall satisfie for Man, be judg’d and die,<br/>
And dying rise, and rising with him raise<br/>
His Brethren, ransomd with his own dear life.<br/>
So Heav’nly love shal outdoo Hellish hate,<br/>
Giving to death, and dying to redeeme,<br/>
So dearly to redeem what Hellish hate<br/>
So easily destroy’d, and still destroyes<br/>
In those who, when they may, accept not grace.<br/>
Nor shalt thou by descending to assume<br/>
Mans Nature, less’n or degrade thine owne.<br/>
Because thou hast, though Thron’d in highest bliss<br/>
Equal to God, and equally enjoying<br/>
God-like fruition, quitted all to save<br/>
A World from utter loss, and hast been found<br/>
By Merit more then Birthright Son of God,<br/>
Found worthiest to be so by being Good,<br/>
Farr more then Great or High; because in thee<br/>
Love hath abounded more then Glory abounds,<br/>
Therefore thy Humiliation shall exalt<br/>
With thee thy Manhood also to this Throne;<br/>
Here shalt thou sit incarnate, here shalt Reigne<br/>
Both God and Man, Son both of God and Man,<br/>
Anointed universal King; all Power<br/>
I give thee, reign for ever, and assume<br/>
Thy Merits; under thee as Head Supream<br/>
Thrones, Princedoms, Powers, Dominions I reduce:<br/>
All knees to thee shall bow, of them that bide<br/>
In Heaven, or Earth, or under Earth in Hell;<br/>
When thou attended gloriously from Heav’n<br/>
Shalt in the Skie appeer, and from thee send<br/>
The summoning Arch-Angels to proclaime<br/>
Thy dread Tribunal: forthwith from all Windes<br/>
The living, and forthwith the cited dead<br/>
Of all past Ages to the general Doom<br/>
Shall hast’n, such a peal shall rouse thir sleep.<br/>
Then all thy Saints assembl’d, thou shalt judge<br/>
Bad men and Angels, they arraignd shall sink<br/>
Beneath thy Sentence; Hell, her numbers full,<br/>
Thenceforth shall be for ever shut.  Mean while<br/>
The World shall burn, and from her ashes spring<br/>
New Heav’n and Earth, wherein the just shall dwell<br/>
And after all thir tribulations long<br/>
See golden days, fruitful of golden deeds,<br/>
With Joy and Love triumphing, and fair Truth.<br/>
Then thou thy regal Scepter shalt lay by,<br/>
For regal Scepter then no more shall need,<br/>
God shall be All in All.  But all ye Gods,<br/>
Adore him, who to compass all this dies,<br/>
Adore the Son, and honour him as mee.<br/>
</p>
				<p class="poem">No sooner had th’ Almighty ceas’t, but all<br/>
The multitude of Angels with a shout<br/>
Loud as from numbers without number, sweet<br/>
As from blest voices, uttering joy, Heav’n rung<br/>
With Jubilee, and loud Hosanna’s fill’d<br/>
Th’ eternal Regions: lowly reverent<br/>
Towards either Throne they bow, &amp; to the ground<br/>
With solemn adoration down they cast<br/>
Thir Crowns inwove with Amarant and Gold,<br/>
Immortal Amarant, a Flour which once<br/>
In Paradise, fast by the Tree of Life<br/>
Began to bloom, but soon for mans offence<br/>
To Heav’n remov’d where first it grew, there grows,<br/>
And flours aloft shading the Fount of Life,<br/>
And where the river of Bliss through midst of Heavn<br/>
Rowls o’re <i>Elisian</i> Flours her Amber stream;<br/>
With these that never fade the Spirits Elect<br/>
Bind thir resplendent locks inwreath’d with beams,<br/>
Now in loose Garlands thick thrown off, the bright<br/>
Pavement that like a Sea of Jasper shon<br/>
Impurpl’d with Celestial Roses smil’d.<br/>
Then Crown’d again thir gold’n Harps they took,<br/>
Harps ever tun’d, that glittering by their side<br/>
Like Quivers hung, and with Praeamble sweet<br/>
Of charming symphonie they introduce<br/>
Thir sacred Song, and waken raptures high;<br/>
No voice exempt, no voice but well could joine<br/>
Melodious part, such concord is in Heav’n.<br/>
</p>
				<p class="poem">Thee Father first they sung Omnipotent,<br/>
Immutable, Immortal, Infinite,<br/>
Eternal King; thee Author of all being,<br/>
Fountain of Light, thy self invisible<br/>
Amidst the glorious brightness where thou sit’st<br/>
Thron’d inaccessible, but when thou shad’st<br/>
The full blaze of thy beams, and through a cloud<br/>
Drawn round about thee like a radiant Shrine,<br/>
Dark with excessive bright thy skirts appeer,<br/>
Yet dazle Heav’n, that brightest Seraphim<br/>
Approach not, but with both wings veil thir eyes.<br/>
Thee next they sang of all Creation first,<br/>
Begotten Son, Divine Similitude,<br/>
In whose conspicuous count’nance, without cloud<br/>
Made visible, th’ Almighty Father shines,<br/>
Whom else no Creature can behold; on thee<br/>
Impresst the effulgence of his Glorie abides,<br/>
Transfus’d on thee his ample Spirit rests.<br/>
Hee Heav’n of Heavens and all the Powers therein<br/>
By thee created, and by thee threw down<br/>
Th’ aspiring Dominations: thou that day<br/>
Thy Fathers dreadful Thunder didst not spare,<br/>
Nor stop thy flaming Chariot wheels, that shook<br/>
Heav’ns everlasting Frame, while o’re the necks<br/>
Thou drov’st of warring Angels disarraid.<br/>
Back from pursuit thy Powers with loud acclaime<br/>
Thee only extold, Son of thy Fathers might,<br/>
To execute fierce vengeance on his foes,<br/>
Not so on Man; him through their malice fall’n,<br/>
Father of Mercie and Grace, thou didst not doome<br/>
So strictly, but much more to pitie encline:<br/>
No sooner did thy dear and onely Son<br/>
Perceive thee purpos’d not to doom frail Man<br/>
So strictly, but much more to pitie enclin’d,<br/>
He to appease thy wrauth, and end the strife<br/>
Of Mercy and Justice in thy face discern’d,<br/>
Regardless of the Bliss wherein hee sat<br/>
Second to thee, offerd himself to die<br/>
For mans offence.  O unexampl’d love,<br/>
Love no where to be found less then Divine!<br/>
Hail Son of God, Saviour of Men, thy Name<br/>
Shall be the copious matter of my Song<br/>
Henceforth, and never shall my Harp thy praise<br/>
Forget, nor from thy Fathers praise disjoine.<br/>
</p>
				<p class="poem">Thus they in Heav’n, above the starry Sphear,<br/>
Thir happie hours in joy and hymning spent.<br/>
Mean while upon the firm opacous Globe<br/>
Of this round World, whose first convex divides<br/>
The luminous inferior Orbs, enclos’d<br/>
From <i>Chaos</i> and th’ inroad of Darkness old,<br/>
<i>Satan</i> alighted walks: a Globe farr off<br/>
It seem’d, now seems a boundless Continent<br/>
Dark, waste, and wild, under the frown of Night<br/>
Starless expos’d, and ever-threatning storms<br/>
Of <i>Chaos</i> blustring round, inclement skie;<br/>
Save on that side which from the wall of Heav’n<br/>
Though distant farr som small reflection gaines<br/>
Of glimmering air less vext with tempest loud:<br/>
Here walk’d the Fiend at large in spacious field.<br/>
As when a Vultur on <i>Imaus</i> bred,<br/>
Whose snowie ridge the roving <i>Tartar</i> bounds,<br/>
Dislodging from a Region scarce of prey<br/>
To gorge the flesh of Lambs or yeanling Kids<br/>
On Hills where Flocks are fed, flies toward the Springs<br/>
Of <i>Ganges</i> or <i>Hydaspes, Indian</i> streams;<br/>
But in his way lights on the barren plaines<br/>
Of <i>Sericana</i>, where <i>Chineses</i> drive<br/>
With Sails and Wind thir canie Waggons light:<br/>
So on this windie Sea of Land, the Fiend<br/>
Walk’d up and down alone bent on his prey,<br/>
Alone, for other Creature in this place<br/>
Living or liveless to be found was none,<br/>
None yet, but store hereafter from the earth<br/>
Up hither like Aereal vapours flew<br/>
Of all things transitorie and vain, when Sin<br/>
With vanity had filld the works of men:<br/>
Both all things vain, and all who in vain things<br/>
Built thir fond hopes of Glorie or lasting fame,<br/>
Or happiness in this or th’ other life;<br/>
All who have thir reward on Earth, the fruits<br/>
Of painful Superstition and blind Zeal,<br/>
Naught seeking but the praise of men, here find<br/>
Fit retribution, emptie as thir deeds;<br/>
All th’ unaccomplisht works of Natures hand,<br/>
Abortive, monstrous, or unkindly mixt,<br/>
Dissolvd on earth, fleet hither, and in vain,<br/>
Till final dissolution, wander here,<br/>
Not in the neighbouring Moon, as some have dreamd;<br/>
Those argent Fields more likely habitants,<br/>
Translated Saints, or middle Spirits hold<br/>
Betwixt th’ Angelical and Human kinde:<br/>
Hither of ill-joynd Sons and Daughters born<br/>
First from the ancient World those Giants came<br/>
With many a vain exploit, though then renownd:<br/>
The builders next of <i>Babel</i> on the Plain<br/>
Of <i>Sennaar</i>, and still with vain designe<br/>
New <i>Babels</i>, had they wherewithall, would build:<br/>
Others came single; hee who to be deemd<br/>
A God, leap’d fondly into <i>Aetna</i> flames,<br/>
<i>Empedocles</i>, and hee who to enjoy<br/>
<i>Plato’s Elysium</i>, leap’d into the Sea,<br/>
<i>Cleombrotus</i>, and many more too long,<br/>
Embryo’s and Idiots, Eremits and Friers<br/>
White, Black and Grey, with all thir trumperie.<br/>
Here Pilgrims roam, that stray’d so farr to seek<br/>
In <i>Golgotha</i> him dead, who lives in Heav’n;<br/>
And they who to be sure of Paradise<br/>
Dying put on the weeds of <i>Dominic</i>,<br/>
Or in <i>Franciscan</i> think to pass disguis’d;<br/>
They pass the Planets seven, and pass the fixt,<br/>
And that Crystalline Sphear whose ballance weighs<br/>
The Trepidation talkt, and that first mov’d;<br/>
And now Saint <i>Peter</i> at Heav’ns Wicket seems<br/>
To wait them with his Keys, and now at foot<br/>
Of Heav’ns ascent they lift thir Feet, when loe<br/>
A violent cross wind from either Coast<br/>
Blows them transverse ten thousand Leagues awry<br/>
Into the devious Air; then might ye see<br/>
Cowles, Hoods and Habits with thir wearers tost<br/>
And flutterd into Raggs, then Reliques, Beads,<br/>
Indulgences, Dispenses, Pardons, Bulls,<br/>
The sport of Winds: all these upwhirld aloft<br/>
Fly o’re the backside of the World farr off<br/>
Into a <i>Limbo</i> large and broad, since calld<br/>
The Paradise of Fools, to few unknown<br/>
Long after, now unpeopl’d, and untrod;<br/>
All this dark Globe the Fiend found as he pass’d,<br/>
And long he wanderd, till at last a gleame<br/>
Of dawning light turnd thither-ward in haste<br/>
His travell’d steps; farr distant hee descries<br/>
Ascending by degrees magnificent<br/>
Up to the wall of Heaven a Structure high,<br/>
At top whereof, but farr more rich appeerd<br/>
The work as of a Kingly Palace Gate<br/>
With Frontispice of Diamond and Gold<br/>
Imbellisht, thick with sparkling orient Gemmes<br/>
The Portal shon, inimitable on Earth<br/>
By Model, or by shading Pencil drawn.<br/>
The Stairs were such as whereon <i>Jacob</i> saw<br/>
Angels ascending and descending, bands<br/>
Of Guardians bright, when he from <i>Esau</i> fled<br/>
To <i>Padan-Aram</i> in the field of <i>Luz</i>,<br/>
Dreaming by night under the open Skie,<br/>
And waking cri’d, This is the Gate of Heav’n.<br/>
Each Stair mysteriously was meant, nor stood<br/>
There alwaies, but drawn up to Heav’n somtimes<br/>
Viewless, and underneath a bright Sea flow’d<br/>
Of Jasper, or of liquid Pearle, whereon<br/>
Who after came from Earth, sayling arriv’d,<br/>
Wafted by Angels, or flew o’re the Lake<br/>
Rapt in a Chariot drawn by fiery Steeds.<br/>
The Stairs were then let down, whether to dare<br/>
The Fiend by easie ascent, or aggravate<br/>
His sad exclusion from the dores of Bliss.<br/>
Direct against which op’nd from beneath,<br/>
Just o’re the blissful seat of Paradise,<br/>
A passage down to th’ Earth, a passage wide,<br/>
Wider by farr then that of after-times<br/>
Over Mount <i>Sion</i>, and, though that were large,<br/>
Over the <i>Promis’d Land</i> to God so dear,<br/>
By which, to visit oft those happy Tribes,<br/>
On high behests his Angels to and fro<br/>
Pass’d frequent, and his eye with choice regard<br/>
From <i>Paneas</i> the fount of <i>Jordans</i> flood<br/>
To <i>Beersaba</i>, where the <i>Holy Land</i><br/>
Borders on <i>Aegypt</i> and the <i>Arabian</i> shoare;<br/>
So wide the op’ning seemd, where bounds were set<br/>
To darkness, such as bound the Ocean wave.<br/>
<i>Satan</i> from hence now on the lower stair<br/>
That scal’d by steps of Gold to Heav’n Gate<br/>
Looks down with wonder at the sudden view<br/>
Of all this World at once.  As when a Scout<br/>
Through dark and desart wayes with peril gone<br/>
All night; at last by break of chearful dawne<br/>
Obtains the brow of some high-climbing Hill,<br/>
Which to his eye discovers unaware<br/>
The goodly prospect of some forein land<br/>
First-seen, or some renownd Metropolis<br/>
With glistering Spires and Pinnacles adornd,<br/>
Which now the Rising Sun guilds with his beams.<br/>
Such wonder seis’d, though after Heaven seen,<br/>
The Spirit maligne, but much more envy seis’d<br/>
At sight of all this World beheld so faire.<br/>
Round he surveys, and well might, where he stood<br/>
So high above the circling Canopie<br/>
Of Nights extended shade; from Eastern Point<br/>
Of <i>Libra</i> to the fleecie Starr that bears<br/>
<i>Andromeda</i> farr off <i>Atlantick</i> Seas<br/>
Beyond th’ <i>Horizon</i>; then from Pole to Pole<br/>
He views in bredth, and without longer pause<br/>
Down right into the Worlds first Region throws<br/>
His flight precipitant, and windes with ease<br/>
Through the pure marble Air his oblique way<br/>
Amongst innumerable Starrs, that shon<br/>
Stars distant, but nigh hand seemd other Worlds,<br/>
Or other Worlds they seemd, or happy Iles,<br/>
Like those <i>Hesperian</i> Gardens fam’d of old,<br/>
Fortunate Fields, and Groves and flourie Vales,<br/>
Thrice happy Iles, but who dwelt happy there<br/>
He stayd not to enquire: above them all<br/>
The golden Sun in splendor likest Heaven<br/>
Allur’d his eye: Thither his course he bends<br/>
Through the calm Firmament; but up or downe<br/>
By center, or eccentric, hard to tell,<br/>
Or Longitude, where the great Luminarie<br/>
Alooff the vulgar Constellations thick,<br/>
That from his Lordly eye keep distance due,<br/>
Dispenses Light from farr; they as they move<br/>
Thir Starry dance in numbers that compute<br/>
Days, months, and years, towards his all-chearing Lamp<br/>
Turn swift their various motions, or are turnd<br/>
By his Magnetic beam, that gently warms<br/>
The Univers, and to each inward part<br/>
With gentle penetration, though unseen,<br/>
Shoots invisible vertue even to the deep:<br/>
So wondrously was set his Station bright.<br/>
There lands the Fiend, a spot like which perhaps<br/>
Astronomer in the Sun’s lucent Orbe<br/>
Through his glaz’d Optic Tube yet never saw.<br/>
The place he found beyond expression bright,<br/>
Compar’d with aught on Earth, Medal or Stone;<br/>
Not all parts like, but all alike informd<br/>
With radiant light, as glowing Iron with fire;<br/>
If mettal, part seemd Gold, part Silver cleer;<br/>
If stone, Carbuncle most or Chrysolite,<br/>
Rubie or Topaz, to the Twelve that shon<br/>
In <i>Aarons</i> Brest-plate, and a stone besides<br/>
Imagind rather oft then elsewhere seen,<br/>
That stone, or like to that which here below<br/>
Philosophers in vain so long have sought,<br/>
In vain, though by thir powerful Art they binde<br/>
Volatil <i>Hermes</i>, and call up unbound<br/>
In various shapes old <i>Proteus</i> from the Sea,<br/>
Draind through a Limbec to his Native forme.<br/>
What wonder then if fields and regions here<br/>
Breathe forth <i>Elixir</i> pure, and Rivers run<br/>
Potable Gold, when with one vertuous touch<br/>
Th’ Arch-chimic Sun so farr from us remote<br/>
Produces with Terrestrial Humor mixt<br/>
Here in the dark so many precious things<br/>
Of colour glorious and effect so rare?<br/>
Here matter new to gaze the Devil met<br/>
Undazl’d, farr and wide his eye commands,<br/>
For sight no obstacle found here, nor shade,<br/>
But all Sun-shine, as when his Beams at Noon<br/>
Culminate from th’ <i>Aequator</i>, as they now<br/>
Shot upward still direct, whence no way round<br/>
Shadow from body opaque can fall, and the Aire,<br/>
No where so cleer, sharp’nd his visual ray<br/>
To objects distant farr, whereby he soon<br/>
Saw within kenn a glorious Angel stand,<br/>
The same whom <i>John</i> saw also in the Sun:<br/>
His back was turnd, but not his brightness hid;<br/>
Of beaming sunnie Raies, a golden tiar<br/>
Circl’d his Head, nor less his Locks behind<br/>
Illustrious on his Shoulders fledge with wings<br/>
Lay waving round; on som great charge imploy’d<br/>
Hee seemd, or fixt in cogitation deep.<br/>
Glad was the Spirit impure as now in hope<br/>
To find who might direct his wandring flight<br/>
To Paradise the happie seat of Man,<br/>
His journies end and our beginning woe.<br/>
But first he casts to change his proper shape,<br/>
Which else might work him danger or delay:<br/>
And now a stripling Cherube he appeers,<br/>
Not of the prime, yet such as in his face<br/>
Youth smil’d Celestial, and to every Limb<br/>
Sutable grace diffus’d, so well he feignd;<br/>
Under a Coronet his flowing haire<br/>
In curles on either cheek plaid, wings he wore<br/>
Of many a colourd plume sprinkl’d with Gold,<br/>
His habit fit for speed succinct, and held<br/>
Before his decent steps a Silver wand.<br/>
He drew not nigh unheard, the Angel bright,<br/>
Ere he drew nigh, his radiant visage turnd,<br/>
Admonisht by his eare, and strait was known<br/>
Th’ Arch-Angel <i>Uriel</i>, one of the seav’n<br/>
Who in Gods presence, neerest to his Throne<br/>
Stand ready at command, and are his Eyes<br/>
That run through all the Heav’ns, or down to th’ Earth<br/>
Bear his swift errands over moist and dry,<br/>
O’re Sea and Land: him <i>Satan</i> thus accostes;<br/>
</p>
				<p class="poem"><i>Uriel</i>, for thou of those seav’n Spirits that stand<br/>
In sight of God’s high Throne, gloriously bright,<br/>
The first art wont his great authentic will<br/>
Interpreter through highest Heav’n to bring,<br/>
Where all his Sons thy Embassie attend;<br/>
And here art likeliest by supream decree<br/>
Like honour to obtain, and as his Eye<br/>
To visit oft this new Creation round;<br/>
Unspeakable desire to see, and know<br/>
All these his wondrous works, but chiefly Man,<br/>
His chief delight and favour, him for whom<br/>
All these his works so wondrous he ordaind,<br/>
Hath brought me from the Quires of Cherubim<br/>
Alone thus wandring.  Brightest Seraph tell<br/>
In which of all these shining Orbes hath Man<br/>
His fixed seat, or fixed seat hath none,<br/>
But all these shining Orbes his choice to dwell;<br/>
That I may find him, and with secret gaze,<br/>
Or open admiration him behold<br/>
On whom the great Creator hath bestowd<br/>
Worlds, and on whom hath all these graces powrd;<br/>
That both in him and all things, as is meet,<br/>
The Universal Maker we may praise;<br/>
Who justly hath drivn out his Rebell Foes<br/>
To deepest Hell, and to repair that loss<br/>
Created this new happie Race of Men<br/>
To serve him better: wise are all his wayes.<br/>
</p>
				<p class="poem">So spake the false dissembler unperceivd;<br/>
For neither Man nor Angel can discern<br/>
Hypocrisie, the only evil that walks<br/>
Invisible, except to God alone,<br/>
By his permissive will, through Heav’n and Earth:<br/>
And oft though wisdom wake, suspicion sleeps<br/>
At wisdoms Gate, and to simplicitie<br/>
Resigns her charge, while goodness thinks no ill<br/>
Where no ill seems: Which now for once beguil’d<br/>
<i>Uriel</i>, though Regent of the Sun, and held<br/>
The sharpest sighted Spirit of all in Heav’n;<br/>
Who to the fraudulent Impostor foule<br/>
In his uprightness answer thus returnd.<br/>
Faire Angel, thy desire which tends to know<br/>
The works of God, thereby to glorifie<br/>
The great Work-Maister, leads to no excess<br/>
That reaches blame, but rather merits praise<br/>
The more it seems excess, that led thee hither<br/>
From thy Empyreal Mansion thus alone,<br/>
To witness with thine eyes what some perhaps<br/>
Contented with report heare onely in heav’n:<br/>
For wonderful indeed are all his works,<br/>
Pleasant to know, and worthiest to be all<br/>
Had in remembrance alwayes with delight;<br/>
But what created mind can comprehend<br/>
Thir number, or the wisdom infinite<br/>
That brought them forth, but hid thir causes deep.<br/>
I saw when at his Word the formless Mass,<br/>
This worlds material mould, came to a heap:<br/>
Confusion heard his voice, and wilde uproar<br/>
Stood rul’d, stood vast infinitude confin’d;<br/>
Till at his second bidding darkness fled,<br/>
Light shon, and order from disorder sprung:<br/>
Swift to thir several Quarters hasted then<br/>
The cumbrous Elements, Earth, Flood, Aire, Fire,<br/>
And this Ethereal quintessence of Heav’n<br/>
Flew upward, spirited with various forms,<br/>
That rowld orbicular, and turnd to Starrs<br/>
Numberless, as thou seest, and how they move;<br/>
Each had his place appointed, each his course,<br/>
The rest in circuit walles this Universe.<br/>
Look downward on that Globe whose hither side<br/>
With light from hence, though but reflected, shines;<br/>
That place is Earth the seat of Man, that light<br/>
His day, which else as th’ other Hemisphere<br/>
Night would invade, but there the neighbouring Moon<br/>
(So call that opposite fair Starr) her aide<br/>
Timely interposes, and her monthly round<br/>
Still ending, still renewing, through mid Heav’n;<br/>
With borrowd light her countenance triform<br/>
Hence fills and empties to enlighten th’ Earth,<br/>
And in her pale dominion checks the night.<br/>
That spot to which I point is <i>Paradise</i>,<br/>
<i>Adams</i> abode, those loftie shades his Bowre.<br/>
Thy way thou canst not miss, me mine requires.<br/>
</p>
				<p class="poem">Thus said, he turnd, and <i>Satan</i> bowing low,<br/>
As to superior Spirits is wont in Heaven,<br/>
Where honour due and reverence none neglects,<br/>
Took leave, and toward the coast of Earth beneath,<br/>
Down from th’ Ecliptic, sped with hop’d success,<br/>
Throws his steep flight with many an Aerie wheele,<br/>
Nor staid, till on <i>Niphates</i> top he lights.<br/>
