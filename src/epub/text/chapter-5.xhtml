				<p class="pfirst">Now Morn her rosie steps in th’ Eastern Clime<br/>
Advancing, sow’d the Earth with Orient Pearle,<br/>
When <i>Adam</i> wak’t, so customd, for his sleep<br/>
Was Aerie light, from pure digestion bred,<br/>
And temperat vapors bland, which th’ only sound<br/>
Of leaves and fuming rills, <i>Aurora’s</i> fan,<br/>
Lightly dispers’d, and the shrill Matin Song<br/>
Of Birds on every bough; so much the more<br/>
His wonder was to find unwak’nd <i>Eve</i><br/>
With Tresses discompos’d, and glowing Cheek,<br/>
As through unquiet rest: he on his side<br/>
Leaning half-rais’d, with looks of cordial Love<br/>
Hung over her enamour’d, and beheld<br/>
Beautie, which whether waking or asleep,<br/>
Shot forth peculiar Graces; then with voice<br/>
Milde, as when <i>Zephyrus</i> on <i>Flora</i> breathes,<br/>
Her hand soft touching, whisperd thus.  Awake<br/>
My fairest, my espous’d, my latest found,<br/>
Heav’ns last best gift, my ever new delight,<br/>
Awake, the morning shines, and the fresh field<br/>
Calls us, we lose the prime, to mark how spring<br/>
Our tended Plants, how blows the Citron Grove,<br/>
What drops the Myrrhe, &amp; what the balmie Reed,<br/>
How Nature paints her colours, how the Bee<br/>
Sits on the Bloom extracting liquid sweet.<br/>
</p>
				<p class="poem">Such whispering wak’d her, but with startl’d eye<br/>
On <i>Adam</i>, whom imbracing, thus she spake.<br/>
</p>
				<p class="poem">O Sole in whom my thoughts find all repose,<br/>
My Glorie, my Perfection, glad I see<br/>
Thy face, and Morn return’d, for I this Night,<br/>
Such night till this I never pass’d, have dream’d,<br/>
If dream’d, not as I oft am wont, of thee,<br/>
Works of day pass’t, or morrows next designe,<br/>
But of offence and trouble, which my mind<br/>
Knew never till this irksom night; methought<br/>
Close at mine ear one call’d me forth to walk<br/>
With gentle voice, I thought it thine; it said,<br/>
Why sleepst thou <i>Eve</i>? now is the pleasant time,<br/>
The cool, the silent, save where silence yields<br/>
To the night-warbling Bird, that now awake<br/>
Tunes sweetest his love-labor’d song; now reignes<br/>
Full Orb’d the Moon, and with more pleasing light<br/>
Shadowie sets off the face of things; in vain,<br/>
If none regard; Heav’n wakes with all his eyes,<br/>
Whom to behold but thee, Natures desire,<br/>
In whose sight all things joy, with ravishment<br/>
Attracted by thy beauty still to gaze.<br/>
I rose as at thy call, but found thee not;<br/>
To find thee I directed then my walk;<br/>
And on, methought, alone I pass’d through ways<br/>
That brought me on a sudden to the Tree<br/>
Of interdicted Knowledge: fair it seem’d,<br/>
Much fairer to my Fancie then by day:<br/>
And as I wondring lookt, beside it stood<br/>
One shap’d &amp; wing’d like one of those from Heav’n<br/>
By us oft seen; his dewie locks distill’d<br/>
Ambrosia; on that Tree he also gaz’d;<br/>
And O fair Plant, said he, with fruit surcharg’d,<br/>
Deigns none to ease thy load and taste thy sweet,<br/>
Nor God, nor Man; is Knowledge so despis’d?<br/>
Or envie, or what reserve forbids to taste?<br/>
Forbid who will, none shall from me withhold<br/>
Longer thy offerd good, why else set here?<br/>
This said he paus’d not, but with ventrous Arme<br/>
He pluckt, he tasted; mee damp horror chil’d<br/>
At such bold words voucht with a deed so bold:<br/>
But he thus overjoy’d, O Fruit Divine,<br/>
Sweet of thy self, but much more sweet thus cropt,<br/>
Forbidd’n here, it seems, as onely fit<br/>
For Gods, yet able to make Gods of Men:<br/>
And why not Gods of Men, since good, the more<br/>
Communicated, more abundant growes,<br/>
The Author not impair’d, but honourd more?<br/>
Here, happie Creature, fair Angelic <i>Eve</i>,<br/>
Partake thou also; happie though thou art,<br/>
Happier thou mayst be, worthier canst not be:<br/>
Taste this, and be henceforth among the Gods<br/>
Thy self a Goddess, not to Earth confind,<br/>
But somtimes in the Air, as wee, somtimes<br/>
Ascend to Heav’n, by merit thine, and see<br/>
What life the Gods live there, and such live thou.<br/>
So saying, he drew nigh, and to me held,<br/>
Even to my mouth of that same fruit held part<br/>
Which he had pluckt; the pleasant savourie smell<br/>
So quick’nd appetite, that I, methought,<br/>
Could not but taste.  Forthwith up to the Clouds<br/>
With him I flew, and underneath beheld<br/>
The Earth outstretcht immense, a prospect wide<br/>
And various: wondring at my flight and change<br/>
To this high exaltation; suddenly<br/>
My Guide was gon, and I, me thought, sunk down,<br/>
And fell asleep; but O how glad I wak’d<br/>
To find this but a dream!  Thus <i>Eve</i> her Night<br/>
Related, and thus <i>Adam</i> answerd sad.<br/>
</p>
				<p class="poem">Best Image of my self and dearer half,<br/>
The trouble of thy thoughts this night in sleep<br/>
Affects me equally; nor can I like<br/>
This uncouth dream, of evil sprung I fear;<br/>
Yet evil whence? in thee can harbour none,<br/>
Created pure.  But know that in the Soule<br/>
Are many lesser Faculties that serve<br/>
Reason as chief; among these Fansie next<br/>
Her office holds; of all external things,<br/>
Which the five watchful Senses represent,<br/>
She forms Imaginations, Aerie shapes,<br/>
Which Reason joyning or disjoyning, frames<br/>
All what we affirm or what deny, and call<br/>
Our knowledge or opinion; then retires<br/>
Into her private Cell when Nature rests.<br/>
Oft in her absence mimic Fansie wakes<br/>
To imitate her; but misjoyning shapes,<br/>
Wilde work produces oft, and most in dreams,<br/>
Ill matching words and deeds long past or late.<br/>
Som such resemblances methinks I find<br/>
Of our last Eevnings talk, in this thy dream,<br/>
But with addition strange; yet be not sad.<br/>
Evil into the mind of God or Man<br/>
May come and go, so unapprov’d, and leave<br/>
No spot or blame behind: Which gives me hope<br/>
That what in sleep thou didst abhorr to dream,<br/>
Waking thou never wilt consent to do.<br/>
Be not disheart’nd then, nor cloud those looks<br/>
That wont to be more chearful and serene<br/>
Then when fair Morning first smiles on the World,<br/>
And let us to our fresh imployments rise<br/>
Among the Groves, the Fountains, and the Flours<br/>
That open now thir choicest bosom’d smells<br/>
Reservd from night, and kept for thee in store.<br/>
</p>
				<p class="poem">So cheard he his fair Spouse, and she was cheard,<br/>
But silently a gentle tear let fall<br/>
From either eye, and wip’d them with her haire;<br/>
Two other precious drops that ready stood,<br/>
Each in thir chrystal sluce, hee ere they fell<br/>
Kiss’d as the gracious signs of sweet remorse<br/>
And pious awe, that feard to have offended.<br/>
</p>
				<p class="poem">So all was cleard, and to the Field they haste.<br/>
But first from under shadie arborous roof,<br/>
Soon as they forth were come to open sight<br/>
Of day-spring, and the Sun, who scarce up risen<br/>
With wheels yet hov’ring o’re the Ocean brim,<br/>
Shot paralel to the earth his dewie ray,<br/>
Discovering in wide Lantskip all the East<br/>
Of Paradise and <i>Edens</i> happie Plains,<br/>
Lowly they bow’d adoring, and began<br/>
Thir Orisons, each Morning duly paid<br/>
In various style, for neither various style<br/>
Nor holy rapture wanted they to praise<br/>
Thir Maker, in fit strains pronounc’t or sung<br/>
Unmeditated, such prompt eloquence<br/>
Flowd from thir lips, in Prose or numerous Verse,<br/>
More tuneable then needed Lute or Harp<br/>
To add more sweetness, and they thus began.<br/>
</p>
				<p class="poem">These are thy glorious works, Parent of good,<br/>
Almightie, thine this universal Frame,<br/>
Thus wondrous fair; thy self how wondrous then!<br/>
Unspeakable, who sitst above these Heavens<br/>
To us invisible or dimly seen<br/>
In these thy lowest works, yet these declare<br/>
Thy goodness beyond thought, and Power Divine:<br/>
Speak yee who best can tell, ye Sons of light,<br/>
Angels, for yee behold him, and with songs<br/>
And choral symphonies, Day without Night,<br/>
Circle his Throne rejoycing, yee in Heav’n,<br/>
On Earth joyn all yee Creatures to extoll<br/>
Him first, him last, him midst, and without end.<br/>
Fairest of Starrs, last in the train of Night,<br/>
If better thou belong not to the dawn,<br/>
Sure pledge of day, that crownst the smiling Morn<br/>
With thy bright Circlet, praise him in thy Spheare<br/>
While day arises, that sweet hour of Prime.<br/>
Thou Sun, of this great World both Eye and Soule,<br/>
Acknowledge him thy Greater, sound his praise<br/>
In thy eternal course, both when thou climb’st,<br/>
And when high Noon hast gaind, &amp; when thou fallst.<br/>
Moon, that now meetst the orient Sun, now fli’st<br/>
With the fixt Starrs, fixt in thir Orb that flies,<br/>
And yee five other wandring Fires that move<br/>
In mystic Dance not without Song, resound<br/>
His praise, who out of Darkness call’d up Light.<br/>
Aire, and ye Elements the eldest birth<br/>
Of Natures Womb, that in quaternion run<br/>
Perpetual Circle, multiform; and mix<br/>
And nourish all things, let your ceasless change<br/>
Varie to our great Maker still new praise.<br/>
Ye Mists and Exhalations that now rise<br/>
From Hill or steaming Lake, duskie or grey,<br/>
Till the Sun paint your fleecie skirts with Gold,<br/>
In honour to the Worlds great Author rise,<br/>
Whether to deck with Clouds the uncolourd skie,<br/>
Or wet the thirstie Earth with falling showers,<br/>
Rising or falling still advance his praise.<br/>
His praise ye Winds, that from four Quarters blow,<br/>
Breath soft or loud; and wave your tops, ye Pines,<br/>
With every Plant, in sign of Worship wave.<br/>
Fountains and yee, that warble, as ye flow,<br/>
Melodious murmurs, warbling tune his praise.<br/>
Joyn voices all ye living Souls, ye Birds,<br/>
That singing up to Heaven Gate ascend,<br/>
Bear on your wings and in your notes his praise;<br/>
Yee that in Waters glide, and yee that walk<br/>
The Earth, and stately tread, or lowly creep;<br/>
Witness if I be silent, Morn or Eeven,<br/>
To Hill, or Valley, Fountain, or fresh shade<br/>
Made vocal by my Song, and taught his praise.<br/>
Hail universal Lord, be bounteous still<br/>
To give us onely good; and if the night<br/>
Have gathered aught of evil or conceald,<br/>
Disperse it, as now light dispels the dark.<br/>
</p>
				<p class="poem">So pray’d they innocent, and to thir thoughts<br/>
Firm peace recoverd soon and wonted calm.<br/>
On to thir mornings rural work they haste<br/>
Among sweet dewes and flours; where any row<br/>
Of Fruit-trees overwoodie reachd too farr<br/>
Thir pamperd boughes, and needed hands to check<br/>
Fruitless imbraces: or they led the Vine<br/>
To wed her Elm; she spous’d about him twines<br/>
Her mariageable arms, and with her brings<br/>
Her dowr th’ adopted Clusters, to adorn<br/>
His barren leaves.  Them thus imploid beheld<br/>
With pittie Heav’ns high King, and to him call’d<br/>
<i>Raphael</i>, the sociable Spirit, that deign’d<br/>
To travel with <i>Tobias</i>, and secur’d<br/>
His marriage with the seaventimes-wedded Maid.<br/>
</p>
				<p class="poem"><i>Raphael</i>, said hee, thou hear’st what stir on Earth<br/>
<i>Satan</i> from Hell scap’t through the darksom Gulf<br/>
Hath raisd in Paradise, and how disturbd<br/>
This night the human pair, how he designes<br/>
In them at once to ruin all mankind.<br/>
Go therefore, half this day as friend with friend<br/>
Converse with <i>Adam</i>, in what Bowre or shade<br/>
Thou find’st him from the heat of Noon retir’d,<br/>
To respit his day-labour with repast,<br/>
Or with repose; and such discourse bring on,<br/>
As may advise him of his happie state,<br/>
Happiness in his power left free to will,<br/>
Left to his own free Will, his Will though free,<br/>
Yet mutable; whence warne him to beware<br/>
He swerve not too secure: tell him withall<br/>
His danger, and from whom, what enemie<br/>
Late falln himself from Heav’n, is plotting now<br/>
The fall of others from like state of bliss;<br/>
By violence, no, for that shall be withstood,<br/>
But by deceit and lies; this let him know,<br/>
Least wilfully transgressing he pretend<br/>
Surprisal, unadmonisht, unforewarnd.<br/>
</p>
				<p class="poem">So spake th’ Eternal Father, and fulfilld<br/>
All Justice: nor delaid the winged Saint<br/>
After his charge receivd, but from among<br/>
Thousand Celestial Ardors, where he stood<br/>
Vaild with his gorgeous wings, up springing light<br/>
Flew through the midst of Heav’n; th’ angelic Quires<br/>
On each hand parting, to his speed gave way<br/>
Through all th’ Empyreal road; till at the Gate<br/>
Of Heav’n arriv’d, the gate self-opend wide<br/>
On golden Hinges turning, as by work<br/>
Divine the sov’ran Architect had fram’d.<br/>
From hence, no cloud, or, to obstruct his sight,<br/>
Starr interpos’d, however small he sees,<br/>
Not unconform to other shining Globes,<br/>
Earth and the Gard’n of God, with Cedars crownd<br/>
Above all Hills.  As when by night the Glass<br/>
Of <i>Galileo</i>, less assur’d, observes<br/>
Imagind Lands and Regions in the Moon:<br/>
Or Pilot from amidst the <i>Cyclades</i><br/>
<i>Delos</i> or <i>Samos</i> first appeering kenns<br/>
A cloudy spot.  Down thither prone in flight<br/>
He speeds, and through the vast Ethereal Skie<br/>
Sailes between worlds &amp; worlds, with steddie wing<br/>
Now on the polar windes, then with quick Fann<br/>
Winnows the buxom Air; till within soare<br/>
Of Towring Eagles, to all the Fowles he seems<br/>
A <i>Phoenix</i>, gaz’d by all, as that sole Bird<br/>
When to enshrine his reliques in the Sun’s<br/>
Bright Temple, to <i>Aegyptian Theb’s</i> he flies.<br/>
At once on th’ Eastern cliff of Paradise<br/>
He lights, and to his proper shape returns<br/>
A Seraph wingd; six wings he wore, to shade<br/>
His lineaments Divine; the pair that clad<br/>
Each shoulder broad, came mantling o’re his brest<br/>
With regal Ornament; the middle pair<br/>
Girt like a Starrie Zone his waste, and round<br/>
Skirted his loines and thighes with downie Gold<br/>
And colours dipt in Heav’n; the third his feet<br/>
Shaddowd from either heele with featherd maile<br/>
Skie-tinctur’d grain.  Like <i>Maia’s</i> son he stood,<br/>
And shook his Plumes, that Heav’nly fragrance filld<br/>
The circuit wide.  Strait knew him all the bands<br/>
Of Angels under watch; and to his state,<br/>
And to his message high in honour rise;<br/>
For on som message high they guessd him bound.<br/>
Thir glittering Tents he passd, and now is come<br/>
Into the blissful field, through Groves of Myrrhe,<br/>
And flouring Odours, Cassia, Nard, and Balme;<br/>
A Wilderness of sweets; for Nature here<br/>
Wantond as in her prime, and plaid at will<br/>
Her Virgin Fancies, pouring forth more sweet,<br/>
Wilde above rule or art; enormous bliss.<br/>
Him through the spicie Forrest onward com<br/>
<i>Adam</i> discernd, as in the dore he sat<br/>
Of his coole Bowre, while now the mounted Sun<br/>
Shot down direct his fervid Raies, to warme<br/>
Earths inmost womb, more warmth then <i>Adam</i> need;<br/>
And <i>Eve</i> within, due at her hour prepar’d<br/>
For dinner savourie fruits, of taste to please<br/>
True appetite, and not disrelish thirst<br/>
Of nectarous draughts between, from milkie stream,<br/>
Berrie or Grape: to whom thus <i>Adam</i> call’d.<br/>
</p>
				<p class="poem">Haste hither <i>Eve</i>, and worth thy sight behold<br/>
Eastward among those Trees, what glorious shape<br/>
Comes this way moving; seems another Morn<br/>
Ris’n on mid-noon; som great behest from Heav’n<br/>
To us perhaps he brings, and will voutsafe<br/>
This day to be our Guest.  But goe with speed,<br/>
And what thy stores contain, bring forth and poure<br/>
Abundance, fit to honour and receive<br/>
Our Heav’nly stranger; well we may afford<br/>
Our givers thir own gifts, and large bestow<br/>
From large bestowd, where Nature multiplies<br/>
Her fertil growth, and by disburd’ning grows<br/>
More fruitful, which instructs us not to spare.<br/>
</p>
				<p class="poem">To whom thus <i>Eve</i>. <i>Adam</i>, earths hallowd mould,<br/>
Of God inspir’d, small store will serve, where store,<br/>
All seasons, ripe for use hangs on the stalk;<br/>
Save what by frugal storing firmness gains<br/>
To nourish, and superfluous moist consumes:<br/>
But I will haste and from each bough and break,<br/>
Each Plant &amp; juciest Gourd will pluck such choice<br/>
To entertain our Angel guest, as hee<br/>
Beholding shall confess that here on Earth<br/>
God hath dispenst his bounties as in Heav’n.<br/>
</p>
				<p class="poem">So saying, with dispatchful looks in haste<br/>
She turns, on hospitable thoughts intent<br/>
What choice to chuse for delicacie best,<br/>
What order, so contriv’d as not to mix<br/>
Tastes, not well joynd, inelegant, but bring<br/>
Taste after taste upheld with kindliest change,<br/>
Bestirs her then, and from each tender stalk<br/>
Whatever Earth all-bearing Mother yeilds<br/>
In <i>India</i> East or West, or middle shoare<br/>
In <i>Pontus</i> or the <i>Punic</i> Coast, or where<br/>
<i>Alcinous</i> reign’d, fruit of all kindes, in coate,<br/>
Rough, or smooth rin’d, or bearded husk, or shell<br/>
She gathers, Tribute large, and on the board<br/>
Heaps with unsparing hand; for drink the Grape<br/>
She crushes, inoffensive moust, and meathes<br/>
From many a berrie, and from sweet kernels prest<br/>
She tempers dulcet creams, nor these to hold<br/>
Wants her fit vessels pure, then strews the ground<br/>
With Rose and Odours from the shrub unfum’d.<br/>
Mean while our Primitive great Sire, to meet<br/>
His god-like Guest, walks forth, without more train<br/>
Accompani’d then with his own compleat<br/>
Perfections, in himself was all his state,<br/>
More solemn then the tedious pomp that waits<br/>
On Princes, when thir rich Retinue long<br/>
Of Horses led, and Grooms besmeard with Gold<br/>
Dazles the croud, and sets them all agape.<br/>
Neerer his presence <i>Adam</i> though not awd,<br/>
Yet with submiss approach and reverence meek,<br/>
As to a superior Nature, bowing low,<br/>
</p>
				<p class="poem">Thus said.  Native of Heav’n, for other place<br/>
None can then Heav’n such glorious shape contain;<br/>
Since by descending from the Thrones above,<br/>
Those happie places thou hast deignd a while<br/>
To want, and honour these, voutsafe with us<br/>
Two onely, who yet by sov’ran gift possess<br/>
This spacious ground, in yonder shadie Bowre<br/>
To rest, and what the Garden choicest bears<br/>
To sit and taste, till this meridian heat<br/>
Be over, and the Sun more coole decline.<br/>
</p>
				<p class="poem">Whom thus the Angelic Vertue answerd milde.<br/>
<i>Adam</i>, I therefore came, nor art thou such<br/>
Created, or such place hast here to dwell,<br/>
As may not oft invite, though Spirits of Heav’n<br/>
To visit thee; lead on then where thy Bowre<br/>
Oreshades; for these mid-hours, till Eevning rise<br/>
I have at will.  So to the Silvan Lodge<br/>
They came, that like <i>Pomona’s</i> Arbour smil’d<br/>
With flourets deck’t and fragrant smells; but <i>Eve</i><br/>
Undeckt, save with her self more lovely fair<br/>
Then Wood-Nymph, or the fairest Goddess feign’d<br/>
Of three that in Mount <i>Ida</i> naked strove,<br/>
Stood to entertain her guest from Heav’n; no vaile<br/>
Shee needed, Vertue-proof, no thought infirme<br/>
Alterd her cheek.  On whom the Angel <i>Haile</i><br/>
Bestowd, the holy salutation us’d<br/>
Long after to blest <i>Marie</i>, second <i>Eve</i>.<br/>
</p>
				<p class="poem">Haile Mother of Mankind, whose fruitful Womb<br/>
Shall fill the World more numerous with thy Sons<br/>
Then with these various fruits the Trees of God<br/>
Have heap’d this Table.  Rais’d of grassie terf<br/>
Thir Table was, and mossie seats had round,<br/>
And on her ample Square from side to side<br/>
All <i>Autumn</i> pil’d, though <i>Spring</i> and <i>Autumn</i> here<br/>
Danc’d hand in hand.  A while discourse they hold;<br/>
No fear lest Dinner coole; when thus began<br/>
Our Authour.  Heav’nly stranger, please to taste<br/>
These bounties which our Nourisher, from whom<br/>
All perfet good unmeasur’d out, descends,<br/>
To us for food and for delight hath caus’d<br/>
The Earth to yeild; unsavourie food perhaps<br/>
To spiritual Natures; only this I know,<br/>
That one Celestial Father gives to all.<br/>
</p>
				<p class="poem">To whom the Angel.  Therefore what he gives<br/>
(Whose praise be ever sung) to man in part<br/>
Spiritual, may of purest Spirits be found<br/>
No ingrateful food: and food alike those pure<br/>
Intelligential substances require<br/>
As doth your Rational; and both contain<br/>
Within them every lower facultie<br/>
Of sense, whereby they hear, see, smell, touch, taste,<br/>
Tasting concoct, digest, assimilate,<br/>
And corporeal to incorporeal turn.<br/>
For know, whatever was created, needs<br/>
To be sustaind and fed; of Elements<br/>
The grosser feeds the purer, earth the sea,<br/>
Earth and the Sea feed Air, the Air those Fires<br/>
Ethereal, and as lowest first the Moon;<br/>
Whence in her visage round those spots, unpurg’d<br/>
Vapours not yet into her substance turnd.<br/>
Nor doth the Moon no nourishment exhale<br/>
From her moist Continent to higher Orbes.<br/>
The Sun that light imparts to all, receives<br/>
From all his alimental recompence<br/>
In humid exhalations, and at Even<br/>
Sups with the Ocean: though in Heav’n the Trees<br/>
Of life ambrosial frutage bear, and vines<br/>
Yeild Nectar, though from off the boughs each Morn<br/>
We brush mellifluous Dewes, and find the ground<br/>
Cover’d with pearly grain: yet God hath here<br/>
Varied his bounty so with new delights,<br/>
As may compare with Heaven; and to taste<br/>
Think not I shall be nice.  So down they sat,<br/>
And to thir viands fell, nor seemingly<br/>
The Angel, nor in mist, the common gloss<br/>
Of Theologians, but with keen dispatch<br/>
Of real hunger, and concoctive heate<br/>
To transubstantiate; what redounds, transpires<br/>
Through Spirits with ease; nor wonder; if by fire<br/>
Of sooty coal the Empiric Alchimist<br/>
Can turn, or holds it possible to turn<br/>
Metals of drossiest Ore to perfet Gold<br/>
As from the Mine.  Mean while at Table <i>Eve</i><br/>
Ministerd naked, and thir flowing cups<br/>
With pleasant liquors crown’d: O innocence<br/>
Deserving Paradise! if ever, then,<br/>
Then had the Sons of God excuse to have bin<br/>
Enamour’d at that sight; but in those hearts<br/>
Love unlibidinous reign’d, nor jealousie<br/>
Was understood, the injur’d Lovers Hell.<br/>
</p>
				<p class="poem">Thus when with meats &amp; drinks they had suffic’d,<br/>
Not burd’nd Nature, sudden mind arose<br/>
In <i>Adam</i>, not to let th’ occasion pass<br/>
Given him by this great Conference to know<br/>
Of things above his World, and of thir being<br/>
Who dwell in Heav’n, whose excellence he saw<br/>
Transcend his own so farr, whose radiant forms<br/>
Divine effulgence, whose high Power so far<br/>
Exceeded human, and his wary speech<br/>
Thus to th’ Empyreal Minister he fram’d.<br/>
</p>
				<p class="poem">Inhabitant with God, now know I well<br/>
Thy favour, in this honour done to man,<br/>
Under whose lowly roof thou hast voutsaf’t<br/>
To enter, and these earthly fruits to taste,<br/>
Food not of Angels, yet accepted so,<br/>
As that more willingly thou couldst not seem<br/>
At Heav’ns high feasts to have fed: yet what compare?<br/>
</p>
				<p class="poem">To whom the winged Hierarch repli’d.<br/>
O <i>Adam</i>, one Almightie is, from whom<br/>
All things proceed, and up to him return,<br/>
If not deprav’d from good, created all<br/>
Such to perfection, one first matter all,<br/>
Indu’d with various forms, various degrees<br/>
Of substance, and in things that live, of life;<br/>
But more refin’d, more spiritous, and pure,<br/>
As neerer to him plac’t or neerer tending<br/>
Each in thir several active Sphears assignd,<br/>
Till body up to spirit work, in bounds<br/>
Proportiond to each kind.  So from the root<br/>
Springs lighter the green stalk, from thence the leaves<br/>
More aerie, last the bright consummate floure<br/>
Spirits odorous breathes: flours and thir fruit<br/>
Mans nourishment, by gradual scale sublim’d<br/>
To vital Spirits aspire, to animal,<br/>
To intellectual, give both life and sense,<br/>
Fansie and understanding, whence the soule<br/>
Reason receives, and reason is her being,<br/>
Discursive, or Intuitive; discourse<br/>
Is oftest yours, the latter most is ours,<br/>
Differing but in degree, of kind the same.<br/>
Wonder not then, what God for you saw good<br/>
If I refuse not, but convert, as you,<br/>
To proper substance; time may come when men<br/>
With Angels may participate, and find<br/>
No inconvenient Diet, nor too light Fare:<br/>
And from these corporal nutriments perhaps<br/>
Your bodies may at last turn all to Spirit<br/>
Improv’d by tract of time, and wingd ascend<br/>
Ethereal, as wee, or may at choice<br/>
Here or in Heav’nly Paradises dwell;<br/>
If ye be found obedient, and retain<br/>
Unalterably firm his love entire<br/>
Whose progenie you are.  Mean while enjoy<br/>
Your fill what happiness this happie state<br/>
Can comprehend, incapable of more.<br/>
</p>
				<p class="poem">To whom the Patriarch of mankind repli’d.<br/>
O favourable spirit, propitious guest,<br/>
Well hast thou taught the way that might direct<br/>
Our knowledge, and the scale of Nature set<br/>
From center to circumference, whereon<br/>
In contemplation of created things<br/>
By steps we may ascend to God.  But say,<br/>
What meant that caution joind, <i>If ye be found<br/>
obedient?</i> can wee want obedience then<br/>
To him, or possibly his love desert<br/>
Who formd us from the dust, and plac’d us here<br/>
Full to the utmost measure of what bliss<br/>
Human desires can seek or apprehend?<br/>
</p>
				<p class="poem">To whom the Angel.  Son of Heav’n and Earth,<br/>
Attend: That thou art happie, owe to God;<br/>
That thou continu’st such, owe to thy self,<br/>
That is, to thy obedience; therein stand.<br/>
This was that caution giv’n thee; be advis’d.<br/>
God made thee perfet, not immutable;<br/>
And good he made thee, but to persevere<br/>
He left it in thy power, ordaind thy will<br/>
By nature free, not over-rul’d by Fate<br/>
Inextricable, or strict necessity;<br/>
Our voluntarie service he requires,<br/>
Not our necessitated, such with him<br/>
Findes no acceptance, nor can find, for how<br/>
Can hearts, not free, be tri’d whether they serve<br/>
Willing or no, who will but what they must<br/>
By Destinie, and can no other choose?<br/>
My self and all th’ Angelic Host that stand<br/>
In sight of God enthron’d, our happie state<br/>
Hold, as you yours, while our obedience holds;<br/>
On other surety none; freely we serve.<br/>
Because wee freely love, as in our will<br/>
To love or not; in this we stand or fall:<br/>
And som are fall’n, to disobedience fall’n,<br/>
And so from Heav’n to deepest Hell; O fall<br/>
From what high state of bliss into what woe!<br/>
</p>
				<p class="poem">To whom our great Progenitor.  Thy words<br/>
Attentive, and with more delighted eare<br/>
Divine instructer, I have heard, then when<br/>
Cherubic Songs by night from neighbouring Hills<br/>
Aereal Music send: nor knew I not<br/>
To be both will and deed created free;<br/>
Yet that we never shall forget to love<br/>
Our maker, and obey him whose command<br/>
Single, is yet so just, my constant thoughts<br/>
Assur’d me and still assure: though what thou tellst<br/>
Hath past in Heav’n, som doubt within me move,<br/>
But more desire to hear, if thou consent,<br/>
The full relation, which must needs be strange,<br/>
Worthy of Sacred silence to be heard;<br/>
And we have yet large day, for scarce the Sun<br/>
Hath finisht half his journey, and scarce begins<br/>
His other half in the great Zone of Heav’n.<br/>
</p>
				<p class="poem">Thus <i>Adam</i> made request, and <i>Raphael</i><br/>
After short pause assenting, thus began.<br/>
</p>
				<p class="poem">High matter thou injoinst me, O prime of men,<br/>
Sad task and hard, for how shall I relate<br/>
To human sense th’ invisible exploits<br/>
Of warring Spirits; how without remorse<br/>
The ruin of so many glorious once<br/>
And perfet while they stood; how last unfould<br/>
The secrets of another world, perhaps<br/>
Not lawful to reveal? yet for thy good<br/>
This is dispenc’t, and what surmounts the reach<br/>
Of human sense, I shall delineate so,<br/>
By lik’ning spiritual to corporal forms,<br/>
As may express them best, though what if Earth<br/>
Be but the shaddow of Heav’n, and things therein<br/>
Each to other like, more then on earth is thought?<br/>
</p>
				<p class="poem">As yet this world was not, and <i>Chaos</i> wilde<br/>
Reignd where these Heav’ns now rowl, where Earth now rests<br/>
Upon her Center pois’d, when on a day<br/>
(For Time, though in Eternitie, appli’d<br/>
To motion, measures all things durable<br/>
By present, past, and future) on such day<br/>
As Heav’ns great Year brings forth, th’ Empyreal Host<br/>
Of Angels by Imperial summons call’d,<br/>
Innumerable before th’ Almighties Throne<br/>
Forthwith from all the ends of Heav’n appeerd<br/>
Under thir Hierarchs in orders bright<br/>
Ten thousand thousand Ensignes high advanc’d,<br/>
Standards, and Gonfalons twixt Van and Reare<br/>
Streame in the Aire, and for distinction serve<br/>
Of Hierarchies, of Orders, and Degrees;<br/>
Or in thir glittering Tissues bear imblaz’d<br/>
Holy Memorials, acts of Zeale and Love<br/>
Recorded eminent.  Thus when in Orbes<br/>
Of circuit inexpressible they stood,<br/>
Orb within Orb, the Father infinite,<br/>
By whom in bliss imbosom’d sat the Son,<br/>
Amidst as from a flaming Mount, whoseop<br/>
Brightness had made invisible, thus spake.<br/>
</p>
				<p class="poem">Hear all ye Angels, Progenie of Light,<br/>
Thrones, Dominations, Princedoms, Vertues, Powers,<br/>
Hear my Decree, which unrevok’t shall stand.<br/>
This day I have begot whom I declare<br/>
My onely Son, and on this holy Hill<br/>
Him have anointed, whom ye now behold<br/>
At my right hand; your Head I him appoint;<br/>
And by my Self have sworn to him shall bow<br/>
All knees in Heav’n, and shall confess him Lord:<br/>
Under his great Vice-gerent Reign abide<br/>
United as one individual Soule<br/>
For ever happie: him who disobeyes<br/>
Mee disobeyes, breaks union, and that day<br/>
Cast out from God and blessed vision, falls<br/>
Into utter darkness, deep ingulft, his place<br/>
Ordaind without redemption, without end.<br/>
</p>
				<p class="poem">So spake th’ Omnipotent, and with his words<br/>
All seemd well pleas’d, all seem’d, but were not all.<br/>
That day, as other solem dayes, they spent<br/>
In song and dance about the sacred Hill,<br/>
Mystical dance, which yonder starrie Spheare<br/>
Of Planets and of fixt in all her Wheeles<br/>
Resembles nearest, mazes intricate,<br/>
Eccentric, intervolv’d, yet regular<br/>
Then most, when most irregular they seem:<br/>
And in thir motions harmonie Divine<br/>
So smooths her charming tones, that Gods own ear<br/>
Listens delighted.  Eevning approachd<br/>
(For we have also our Eevning and our Morn,<br/>
We ours for change delectable, not need)<br/>
Forthwith from dance to sweet repast they turn<br/>
Desirous, all in Circles as they stood,<br/>
Tables are set, and on a sudden pil’d<br/>
With Angels Food, and rubied Nectar flows:<br/>
In Pearl, in Diamond, and massie Gold,<br/>
Fruit of delicious Vines, the growth of Heav’n.<br/>
They eat, they drink, and with refection sweet<br/>
Are fill’d, before th’ all bounteous King, who showrd<br/>
With copious hand, rejoycing in thir joy.<br/>
Now when ambrosial Night with Clouds exhal’d<br/>
From that high mount of God, whence light &amp; shade<br/>
Spring both, the face of brightest Heav’n had changd<br/>
To grateful Twilight (for Night comes not there<br/>
In darker veile) and roseat Dews dispos’d<br/>
All but the unsleeping eyes of God to rest,<br/>
Wide over all the Plain, and wider farr<br/>
Then all this globous Earth in Plain outspred,<br/>
(Such are the Courts of God) Th’ Angelic throng<br/>
Disperst in Bands and Files thir Camp extend<br/>
By living Streams among the Trees of Life,<br/>
Pavilions numberless, and sudden reard,<br/>
Celestial Tabernacles, where they slept<br/>
Fannd with coole Winds, save those who in thir course<br/>
Melodious Hymns about the sovran Throne<br/>
Alternate all night long: but not so wak’d<br/>
<i>Satan</i>, so call him now, his former name<br/>
Is heard no more Heav’n; he of the first,<br/>
If not the first Arch-Angel, great in Power,<br/>
In favour and praeeminence, yet fraught<br/>
With envie against the Son of God, that day<br/>
Honourd by his great Father, and proclaimd<br/>
<i>Messiah</i> King anointed, could not beare<br/>
Through pride that sight, and thought himself impaird.<br/>
Deep malice thence conceiving &amp; disdain,<br/>
Soon as midnight brought on the duskie houre<br/>
Friendliest to sleep and silence, he resolv’d<br/>
With all his Legions to dislodge, and leave<br/>
Unworshipt, unobey’d the Throne supream<br/>
Contemptuous, and his next subordinate<br/>
Awak’ning, thus to him in secret spake.<br/>
</p>
				<p class="poem">Sleepst thou Companion dear, what sleep can close<br/>
Thy eye-lids? and remembrest what Decree<br/>
Of yesterday, so late hath past the lips<br/>
Of Heav’ns Almightie.  Thou to me thy thoughts<br/>
Wast wont, I mine to thee was wont to impart;<br/>
Both waking we were one; how then can now<br/>
Thy sleep dissent? new Laws thou seest impos’d;<br/>
New Laws from him who reigns, new minds may raise<br/>
In us who serve, new Counsels, to debate<br/>
What doubtful may ensue, more in this place<br/>
To utter is not safe.  Assemble thou<br/>
Of all those Myriads which we lead the chief;<br/>
Tell them that by command, ere yet dim Night<br/>
Her shadowie Cloud withdraws, I am to haste,<br/>
And all who under me thir Banners wave,<br/>
Homeward with flying march where we possess<br/>
The Quarters of the North, there to prepare<br/>
Fit entertainment to receive our King<br/>
The great <i>Messiah</i>, and his new commands,<br/>
Who speedily through all the Hierarchies<br/>
Intends to pass triumphant, and give Laws.<br/>
</p>
				<p class="poem">So spake the false Arch-Angel, and infus’d<br/>
Bad influence into th’ unwarie brest<br/>
Of his Associate; hee together calls,<br/>
Or several one by one, the Regent Powers,<br/>
Under him Regent, tells, as he was taught,<br/>
That the most High commanding, now ere Night,<br/>
Now ere dim Night had disincumberd Heav’n,<br/>
The great Hierarchal Standard was to move;<br/>
Tells the suggested cause, and casts between<br/>
Ambiguous words and jealousies, to sound<br/>
Or taint integritie; but all obey’d<br/>
The wonted signal, and superior voice<br/>
Of thir great Potentate; for great indeed<br/>
His name, and high was his degree in Heav’n;<br/>
His count’nance, as the Morning Starr that guides<br/>
The starrie flock, allur’d them, and with lyes<br/>
Drew after him the third part of Heav’ns Host:<br/>
Mean while th’ Eternal eye, whose sight discernes<br/>
Abstrusest thoughts, from forth his holy Mount<br/>
And from within the golden Lamps that burne<br/>
Nightly before him, saw without thir light<br/>
Rebellion rising, saw in whom, how spred<br/>
Among the sons of Morn, what multitudes<br/>
Were banded to oppose his high Decree;<br/>
And smiling to his onely Son thus said.<br/>
</p>
				<p class="poem">Son, thou in whom my glory I behold<br/>
In full resplendence, Heir of all my might,<br/>
Neerly it now concernes us to be sure<br/>
Of our Omnipotence, and with what Arms<br/>
We mean to hold what anciently we claim<br/>
Of Deitie or Empire, such a foe<br/>
Is rising, who intends to erect his Throne<br/>
Equal to ours, throughout the spacious North;<br/>
Nor so content, hath in his thought to trie<br/>
In battel, what our Power is, or our right.<br/>
Let us advise, and to this hazard draw<br/>
With speed what force is left, and all imploy<br/>
In our defence, lest unawares we lose<br/>
This our high place, our Sanctuarie, our Hill.<br/>
</p>
				<p class="poem">To whom the Son with calm aspect and cleer<br/>
Light’ning Divine, ineffable, serene,<br/>
Made answer.  Mightie Father, thou thy foes<br/>
Justly hast in derision, and secure<br/>
Laugh’st at thir vain designes and tumults vain,<br/>
Matter to mee of Glory, whom thir hate<br/>
Illustrates, when they see all Regal Power<br/>
Giv’n me to quell thir pride, and in event<br/>
Know whether I be dextrous to subdue<br/>
Thy Rebels, or be found the worst in Heav’n.<br/>
</p>
				<p class="poem">So spake the Son, but <i>Satan</i> with his Powers<br/>
Farr was advanc’t on winged speed, an Host<br/>
Innumerable as the Starrs of Night,<br/>
Or Starrs of Morning, Dew-drops, which the Sun<br/>
Impearls on every leaf and every flouer.<br/>
Regions they pass’d, the mightie Regencies<br/>
Of Seraphim and Potentates and Thrones<br/>
In thir triple Degrees, Regions to which<br/>
All thy Dominion, <i>Adam</i>, is no more<br/>
Then what this Garden is to all the Earth,<br/>
And all the Sea, from one entire globose<br/>
Stretcht into Longitude; which having pass’d<br/>
At length into the limits of the North<br/>
They came, and <i>Satan</i> to his Royal seat<br/>
High on a Hill, far blazing, as a Mount<br/>
Rais’d on a Mount, with Pyramids and Towrs<br/>
From Diamond Quarries hew’n, &amp; Rocks of Gold,<br/>
The Palace of great <i>Lucifer</i>, (so call<br/>
That Structure in the Dialect of men<br/>
Interpreted) which not long after, hee<br/>
Affecting all equality with God,<br/>
In imitation of that Mount whereon<br/>
<i>Messiah</i> was declar’d in sight of Heav’n,<br/>
The Mountain of the Congregation call’d;<br/>
For thither he assembl’d all his Train,<br/>
Pretending so commanded to consult<br/>
About the great reception of thir King,<br/>
Thither to come, and with calumnious Art<br/>
Of counterfeted truth thus held thir ears.<br/>
</p>
				<p class="poem">Thrones, Dominations, Princedomes, Vertues, Powers,<br/>
If these magnific Titles yet remain<br/>
Not meerly titular, since by Decree<br/>
Another now hath to himself ingross’t<br/>
All Power, and us eclipst under the name<br/>
Of King anointed, for whom all this haste<br/>
Of midnight march, and hurried meeting here,<br/>
This onely to consult how we may best<br/>
With what may be devis’d of honours new<br/>
Receive him coming to receive from us<br/>
Knee-tribute yet unpaid, prostration vile,<br/>
Too much to one, but double how endur’d,<br/>
To one and to his image now proclaim’d?<br/>
But what if better counsels might erect<br/>
Our minds and teach us to cast off this Yoke?<br/>
Will ye submit your necks, and chuse to bend<br/>
The supple knee? ye will not, if I trust<br/>
To know ye right, or if ye know your selves<br/>
Natives and Sons of Heav’n possest before<br/>
By none, and if not equal all, yet free,<br/>
Equally free; for Orders and Degrees<br/>
Jarr not with liberty, but well consist.<br/>
Who can in reason then or right assume<br/>
Monarchie over such as live by right<br/>
His equals, if in power and splendor less,<br/>
In freedome equal? or can introduce<br/>
Law and Edict on us, who without law<br/>
Erre not, much less for this to be our Lord,<br/>
And look for adoration to th’ abuse<br/>
Of those Imperial Titles which assert<br/>
Our being ordain’d to govern, not to serve?<br/>
</p>
				<p class="poem">Thus farr his bold discourse without controule<br/>
Had audience, when among the Seraphim<br/>
<i>Abdiel</i>, then whom none with more zeale ador’d<br/>
The Deitie, and divine commands obei’d,<br/>
Stood up, and in a flame of zeale severe<br/>
The current of his fury thus oppos’d.<br/>
</p>
				<p class="poem">O argument blasphemous, false and proud!<br/>
Words which no eare ever to hear in Heav’n<br/>
Expected, least of all from thee, ingrate<br/>
In place thy self so high above thy Peeres.<br/>
Canst thou with impious obloquie condemne<br/>
The just Decree of God, pronounc’t and sworn,<br/>
That to his only Son by right endu’d<br/>
With Regal Scepter, every Soule in Heav’n<br/>
Shall bend the knee, and in that honour due<br/>
Confess him rightful King? unjust thou saist<br/>
Flatly unjust, to binde with Laws the free,<br/>
And equal over equals to let Reigne,<br/>
One over all with unsucceeded power.<br/>
Shalt thou give Law to God, shalt thou dispute<br/>
With him the points of libertie, who made<br/>
Thee what thou art, &amp; formd the Pow’rs of Heav’n<br/>
Such as he pleasd, and circumscrib’d thir being?<br/>
Yet by experience taught we know how good,<br/>
And of our good, and of our dignitie<br/>
How provident he is, how farr from thought<br/>
To make us less, bent rather to exalt<br/>
Our happie state under one Head more neer<br/>
United.  But to grant it thee unjust,<br/>
That equal over equals Monarch Reigne:<br/>
Thy self though great &amp; glorious dost thou count,<br/>
Or all Angelic Nature joind in one,<br/>
Equal to him begotten Son, by whom<br/>
As by his Word the mighty Father made<br/>
All things, ev’n thee, and all the Spirits of Heav’n<br/>
By him created in thir bright degrees,<br/>
Crownd them with Glory, &amp; to thir Glory nam’d<br/>
Thrones, Dominations, Princedoms, Vertues, Powers<br/>
Essential Powers, nor by his Reign obscur’d,<br/>
But more illustrious made, since he the Head<br/>
One of our number thus reduc’t becomes,<br/>
His Laws our Laws, all honour to him done<br/>
Returns our own.  Cease then this impious rage,<br/>
And tempt not these; but hast’n to appease<br/>
Th’ incensed Father, and th’ incensed Son,<br/>
While Pardon may be found in time besought.<br/>
</p>
				<p class="poem">So spake the fervent Angel, but his zeale<br/>
None seconded, as out of season judg’d,<br/>
Or singular and rash, whereat rejoic’d<br/>
Th’ Apostat, and more haughty thus repli’d.<br/>
That we were formd then saist thou? &amp; the work<br/>
Of secondarie hands, by task transferd<br/>
From Father to his Son? strange point and new!<br/>
Doctrin which we would know whence learnt: who saw<br/>
When this creation was? rememberst thou<br/>
Thy making, while the Maker gave thee being?<br/>
We know no time when we were not as now;<br/>
Know none before us, self-begot, self-rais’d<br/>
By our own quick’ning power, when fatal course<br/>
Had circl’d his full Orbe, the birth mature<br/>
Of this our native Heav’n, Ethereal Sons.<br/>
Our puissance is our own, our own right hand<br/>
Shall teach us highest deeds, by proof to try<br/>
Who is our equal: then thou shalt behold<br/>
Whether by supplication we intend<br/>
Address, and to begirt th’ Almighty Throne<br/>
Beseeching or besieging.  This report,<br/>
These tidings carrie to th’ anointed King;<br/>
And fly, ere evil intercept thy flight.<br/>
</p>
				<p class="poem">He said, and as the sound of waters deep<br/>
Hoarce murmur echo’d to his words applause<br/>
Through the infinite Host, nor less for that<br/>
The flaming Seraph fearless, though alone<br/>
Encompass’d round with foes, thus answerd bold.<br/>
</p>
				<p class="poem">O alienate from God, O spirit accurst,<br/>
Forsak’n of all good; I see thy fall<br/>
Determind, and thy hapless crew involv’d<br/>
In this perfidious fraud, contagion spred<br/>
Both of thy crime and punishment: henceforth<br/>
No more be troubl’d how to quit the yoke<br/>
Of Gods <i>Messiah</i>; those indulgent Laws<br/>
Will not be now voutsaf’t, other Decrees<br/>
Against thee are gon forth without recall;<br/>
That Golden Scepter which thou didst reject<br/>
Is now an Iron Rod to bruise and breake<br/>
Thy disobedience.  Well thou didst advise,<br/>
Yet not for thy advise or threats I fly<br/>
These wicked Tents devoted, least the wrauth<br/>
Impendent, raging into sudden flame<br/>
Distinguish not: for soon expect to feel<br/>
His Thunder on thy head, devouring fire.<br/>
Then who created thee lamenting learne,<br/>
When who can uncreate thee thou shalt know.<br/>
</p>
				<p class="poem">So spake the Seraph <i>Abdiel</i> faithful found,<br/>
Among the faithless, faithful only hee;<br/>
Among innumerable false, unmov’d,<br/>
Unshak’n, unseduc’d, unterrifi’d<br/>
His Loyaltie he kept, his Love, his Zeale;<br/>
Nor number, nor example with him wrought<br/>
To swerve from truth, or change his constant mind<br/>
Though single.  From amidst them forth he passd,<br/>
Long way through hostile scorn, which he susteind<br/>
Superior, nor of violence fear’d aught;<br/>
And with retorted scorn his back he turn’d<br/>
On those proud Towrs to swift destruction doom’d.<br/>
