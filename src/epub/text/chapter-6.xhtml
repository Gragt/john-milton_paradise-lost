						<span>All night the dreadless Angel unpursu’d</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Through Heav’ns wide Champain held his way, till Morn,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Wak’t by the circling Hours, with rosie hand</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Unbarr’d the gates of Light.  There is a Cave</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Within the Mount of God, fast by his Throne,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Where light and darkness in perpetual round</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Lodge and dislodge by turns, which makes through Heav’n</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Grateful vicissitude, like Day and Night;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Light issues forth, and at the other dore</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Obsequious darkness enters, till her houre</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To veile the Heav’n, though darkness there might well</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Seem twilight here; and now went forth the Morn</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Such as in highest Heav’n, arrayd in Gold</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Empyreal, from before her vanisht Night,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Shot through with orient Beams: when all the Plain</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Coverd with thick embatteld Squadrons bright,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Chariots and flaming Armes, and fierie Steeds</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Reflecting blaze on blaze, first met his view:</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Warr he perceav’d, warr in procinct, and found</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Already known what he for news had thought</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To have reported: gladly then he mixt</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Among those friendly Powers who him receav’d</span>
						<br/>
						<span>With joy and acclamations loud, that one</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That of so many Myriads fall’n, yet one</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Returnd not lost: On to the sacred hill</span>
						<br/>
						<span>They led him high applauded, and present</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Before the seat supream; from whence a voice</span>
						<br/>
						<span>From midst a Golden Cloud thus milde was heard.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>Servant of God, well done, well hast thou fought</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The better fight, who single hast maintaind</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Against revolted multitudes the Cause</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of Truth, in word mightier then they in Armes;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And for the testimonie of Truth hast born</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Universal reproach, far worse to beare</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Then violence: for this was all thy care</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To stand approv’d in sight of God, though Worlds</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Judg’d thee perverse: the easier conquest now</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Remains thee, aided by this host of friends,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Back on thy foes more glorious to return</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Then scornd thou didst depart, and to subdue</span>
						<br/>
						<span>By force, who reason for thir Law refuse,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Right reason for thir Law, and for thir King</span>
						<br/>
						<span><i>Messiah</i>, who by right of merit Reigns.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Goe <i>Michael</i> of Celestial Armies Prince,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And thou in Military prowess next</span>
						<br/>
						<span><i>Gabriel</i>, lead forth to Battel these my Sons</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Invincible, lead forth my armed Saints</span>
						<br/>
						<span>By Thousands and by Millions rang’d for fight;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Equal in number to that Godless crew</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Rebellious, them with Fire and hostile Arms</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Fearless assault, and to the brow of Heav’n</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Pursuing drive them out from God and bliss,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Into thir place of punishment, the Gulf</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of <i>Tartarus</i>, which ready opens wide</span>
						<br/>
						<span>His fiery <i>Chaos</i> to receave thir fall.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>So spake the Sovran voice, and Clouds began</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To darken all the Hill, and smoak to rowl</span>
						<br/>
						<span>In duskie wreathes, reluctant flames, the signe</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of wrauth awak’t: nor with less dread the loud</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Ethereal Trumpet from on high gan blow:</span>
						<br/>
						<span>At which command the Powers Militant,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That stood for Heav’n, in mighty Quadrate joyn’d</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of Union irresistible, mov’d on</span>
						<br/>
						<span>In silence thir bright Legions, to the sound</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of instrumental Harmonie that breath’d</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Heroic Ardor to advent’rous deeds</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Under thir God-like Leaders, in the Cause</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of God and his <i>Messiah</i>.  On they move</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Indissolubly firm; nor obvious Hill,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Nor streit’ning Vale, nor Wood, nor Stream divides</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Thir perfet ranks; for high above the ground</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Thir march was, and the passive Air upbore</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Thir nimble tread; as when the total kind</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of Birds in orderly array on wing</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Came summond over <i>Eden</i> to receive</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Thir names of thee; so over many a tract</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of Heav’n they march’d, and many a Province wide</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Tenfold the length of this terrene: at last</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Farr in th’ Horizon to the North appeer’d</span>
						<br/>
						<span>From skirt to skirt a fierie Region, stretcht</span>
						<br/>
						<span>In battailous aspect, and neerer view</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Bristl’d with upright beams innumerable</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of rigid Spears, and Helmets throng’d, and Shields</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Various, with boastful Argument portraid,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The banded Powers of <i>Satan</i> hasting on</span>
						<br/>
						<span>With furious expedition; for they weend</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That self same day by fight, or by surprize</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To win the Mount of God, and on his Throne</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To set the envier of his State, the proud</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Aspirer, but thir thoughts prov’d fond and vain</span>
						<br/>
						<span>In the mid way: though strange to us it seemd</span>
						<br/>
						<span>At first, that Angel should with Angel warr,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And in fierce hosting meet, who wont to meet</span>
						<br/>
						<span>So oft in Festivals of joy and love</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Unanimous, as sons of one great Sire</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Hymning th’ Eternal Father: but the shout</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of Battel now began, and rushing sound</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of onset ended soon each milder thought.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>High in the midst exalted as a God</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Th’ Apostat in his Sun-bright Chariot sate</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Idol of Majestie Divine, enclos’d</span>
						<br/>
						<span>With Flaming Cherubim, and golden Shields;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Then lighted from his gorgeous Throne, for now</span>
						<br/>
						<span>’Twixt Host and Host but narrow space was left,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A dreadful interval, and Front to Front</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Presented stood in terrible array</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of hideous length: before the cloudie Van,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>On the rough edge of battel ere it joyn’d,</span>
						<br/>
						<span><i>Satan</i> with vast and haughtie strides advanc’t,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Came towring, armd in Adamant and Gold;</span>
						<br/>
						<span><i>Abdiel</i> that sight endur’d not, where he stood</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Among the mightiest, bent on highest deeds,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And thus his own undaunted heart explores.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>O Heav’n! that such resemblance of the Highest</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Should yet remain, where faith and realtie</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Remain not; wherfore should not strength &amp; might</span>
						<br/>
						<span>There fail where Vertue fails, or weakest prove</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Where boldest; though to sight unconquerable?</span>
						<br/>
						<span>His puissance, trusting in th’ Almightie’s aide,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>I mean to try, whose Reason I have tri’d</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Unsound and false; nor is it aught but just,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That he who in debate of Truth hath won,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Should win in Arms, in both disputes alike</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Victor; though brutish that contest and foule,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>When Reason hath to deal with force, yet so</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Most reason is that Reason overcome.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>So pondering, and from his armed Peers</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Forth stepping opposite, half way he met</span>
						<br/>
						<span>His daring foe, at this prevention more</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Incens’t, and thus securely him defi’d.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>Proud, art thou met? thy hope was to have reacht</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The highth of thy aspiring unoppos’d,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The Throne of God unguarded, and his side</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Abandond at the terror of thy Power</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Or potent tongue; fool, not to think how vain</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Against th’ Omnipotent to rise in Arms;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Who out of smallest things could without end</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Have rais’d incessant Armies to defeat</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Thy folly; or with solitarie hand</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Reaching beyond all limit, at one blow</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Unaided could have finisht thee, and whelmd</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Thy Legions under darkness; but thou seest</span>
						<br/>
						<span>All are not of thy Train; there be who Faith</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Prefer, and Pietie to God, though then</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To thee not visible, when I alone</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Seemd in thy World erroneous to dissent</span>
						<br/>
						<span>From all: my Sect thou seest, now learn too late</span>
						<br/>
						<span>How few somtimes may know, when thousands err.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>Whom the grand foe with scornful eye askance</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Thus answerd.  Ill for thee, but in wisht houre</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of my revenge, first sought for thou returnst</span>
						<br/>
						<span>From flight, seditious Angel, to receave</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Thy merited reward, the first assay</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of this right hand provok’t, since first that tongue</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Inspir’d with contradiction durst oppose</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A third part of the Gods, in Synod met</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Thir Deities to assert, who while they feel</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Vigour Divine within them, can allow</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Omnipotence to none.  But well thou comst</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Before thy fellows, ambitious to win</span>
						<br/>
						<span>From me som Plume, that thy success may show</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Destruction to the rest: this pause between</span>
						<br/>
						<span>(Unanswerd least thou boast) to let thee know;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>At first I thought that Libertie and Heav’n</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To heav’nly Soules had bin all one; but now</span>
						<br/>
						<span>I see that most through sloth had rather serve,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Ministring Spirits, traind up in Feast and Song;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Such hast thou arm’d, the Minstrelsie of Heav’n,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Servilitie with freedom to contend,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>As both thir deeds compar’d this day shall prove.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>To whom in brief thus <i>Abdiel</i> stern repli’d.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Apostat, still thou errst, nor end wilt find</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of erring, from the path of truth remote:</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Unjustly thou deprav’st it with the name</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of <i>Servitude</i> to serve whom God ordains,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Or Nature; God and Nature bid the same,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>When he who rules is worthiest, and excells</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Them whom he governs.  This is servitude,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To serve th’ unwise, or him who hath rebelld</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Against his worthier, as thine now serve thee,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Thy self not free, but to thy self enthrall’d;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Yet leudly dar’st our ministring upbraid.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Reign thou in Hell thy Kingdom, let mee serve</span>
						<br/>
						<span>In Heav’n God ever blessed, and his Divine</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Behests obey, worthiest to be obey’d,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Yet Chains in Hell, not Realms expect: mean while</span>
						<br/>
						<span>From mee returnd, as erst thou saidst, from flight,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>This greeting on thy impious Crest receive.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>So saying, a noble stroke he lifted high,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Which hung not, but so swift with tempest fell</span>
						<br/>
						<span>On the proud Crest of <i>Satan</i>, that no sight,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Nor motion of swift thought, less could his Shield</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Such ruin intercept: ten paces huge</span>
						<br/>
						<span>He back recoild; the tenth on bended knee</span>
						<br/>
						<span>His massie Spear upstaid; as if on Earth</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Winds under ground or waters forcing way</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Sidelong, had push’t a Mountain from his seat</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Half sunk with all his Pines.  Amazement seis’d</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The Rebel Thrones, but greater rage to see</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Thus foil’d thir mightiest, ours joy filld, and shout,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Presage of Victorie and fierce desire</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of Battel: whereat <i>Michael</i> bid sound</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Th’ Arch-Angel trumpet; through the vast of Heav’n</span>
						<br/>
						<span>It sounded, and the faithful Armies rung</span>
						<br/>
						<span><i>Hosanna</i> to the Highest: nor stood at gaze</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The adverse Legions, nor less hideous joyn’d</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The horrid shock: now storming furie rose,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And clamour such as heard in Heav’n till now</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Was never, Arms on Armour clashing bray’d</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Horrible discord, and the madding Wheeles</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of brazen Chariots rag’d; dire was the noise</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of conflict; over head the dismal hiss</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of fiery Darts in flaming volies flew,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And flying vaulted either Host with fire.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Sounder fierie Cope together rush’d</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Both Battels maine, with ruinous assault</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And inextinguishable rage; all Heav’n</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Resounded, and had Earth bin then, all Earth</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Had to her Center shook.  What wonder? when</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Millions of fierce encountring Angels fought</span>
						<br/>
						<span>On either side, the least of whom could weild</span>
						<br/>
						<span>These Elements, and arm him with the force</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of all thir Regions: how much more of Power</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Armie against Armie numberless to raise</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Dreadful combustion warring, and disturb,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Though not destroy, thir happie Native seat;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Had not th’ Eternal King Omnipotent</span>
						<br/>
						<span>From his strong hold of Heav’n high over-rul’d</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And limited thir might; though numberd such</span>
						<br/>
						<span>As each divided Legion might have seemd</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A numerous Host, in strength each armed hand</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A Legion; led in fight, yet Leader seemd</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Each Warriour single as in Chief, expert</span>
						<br/>
						<span>When to advance, or stand, or turn the sway</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of Battel, open when, and when to close</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The ridges of grim Warr; no thought of flight,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>None of retreat, no unbecoming deed</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That argu’d fear; each on himself reli’d,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>As onely in his arm the moment lay</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of victorie; deeds of eternal fame</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Were don, but infinite: for wide was spred</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That Warr and various; somtimes on firm ground</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A standing fight, then soaring on main wing</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Tormented all the Air; all Air seemd then</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Conflicting Fire: long time in eeven scale</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The Battel hung; till <i>Satan</i>, who that day</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Prodigious power had shewn, and met in Armes</span>
						<br/>
						<span>No equal, raunging through the dire attack</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of fighting Seraphim confus’d, at length</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Saw where the Sword of <i>Michael</i> smote, and fell’d</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Squadrons at once, with huge two-handed sway</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Brandisht aloft the horrid edge came down</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Wide wasting; such destruction to withstand</span>
						<br/>
						<span>He hasted, and oppos’d the rockie Orb</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of tenfold Adamant, his ample Shield</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A vast circumference: At his approach</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The great Arch-Angel from his warlike toile</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Surceas’d, and glad as hoping here to end</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Intestine War in Heav’n, the arch foe subdu’d</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Or Captive drag’d in Chains, with hostile frown</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And visage all enflam’d first thus began.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>Author of evil, unknown till thy revolt,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Unnam’d in Heav’n, now plenteous, as thou seest</span>
						<br/>
						<span>These Acts of hateful strife, hateful to all,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Though heaviest by just measure on thy self</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And thy adherents: how hast thou disturb’d</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Heav’ns blessed peace, and into Nature brought</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Miserie, uncreated till the crime</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of thy Rebellion? how hast thou instill’d</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Thy malice into thousands, once upright</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And faithful, now prov’d false.  But think not here</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To trouble Holy Rest; Heav’n casts thee out</span>
						<br/>
						<span>From all her Confines.  Heav’n the seat of bliss</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Brooks not the works of violence and Warr.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Hence then, and evil go with thee along</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Thy ofspring, to the place of evil, Hell,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Thou and thy wicked crew; there mingle broiles,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Ere this avenging Sword begin thy doome,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Or som more sudden vengeance wing’d from God</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Precipitate thee with augmented paine.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>So spake the Prince of Angels; to whom thus</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The Adversarie.  Nor think thou with wind</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of airie threats to aw whom yet with deeds</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Thou canst not.  Hast thou turnd the least of these</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To flight, or if to fall, but that they rise</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Unvanquisht, easier to transact with mee</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That thou shouldst hope, imperious, &amp; with threats</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To chase me hence? erre not that so shall end</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The strife which thou call’st evil, but wee style</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The strife of Glorie: which we mean to win,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Or turn this Heav’n it self into the Hell</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Thou fablest, here however to dwell free,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>If not to reign: mean while thy utmost force,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And join him nam’d <i>Almightie</i> to thy aid,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>I flie not, but have sought thee farr and nigh.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>They ended parle, and both addrest for fight</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Unspeakable; for who, though with the tongue</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of Angels, can relate, or to what things</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Liken on Earth conspicuous, that may lift</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Human imagination to such highth</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of Godlike Power: for likest Gods they seemd,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Stood they or mov’d, in stature, motion, arms</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Fit to decide the Empire of great Heav’n.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Now wav’d thir fierie Swords, and in the Aire</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Made horrid Circles; two broad Suns thir Shields</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Blaz’d opposite, while expectation stood</span>
						<br/>
						<span>In horror; from each hand with speed retir’d</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Where erst was thickest fight, th’ Angelic throng,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And left large field, unsafe within the wind</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of such commotion, such as to set forth</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Great things by small, If Natures concord broke,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Among the Constellations warr were sprung,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Two Planets rushing from aspect maligne</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of fiercest opposition in mid Skie,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Should combat, and thir jarring Sphears confound.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Together both with next to Almightie Arme,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Uplifted imminent one stroke they aim’d</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That might determine, and not need repeate,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>As not of power, at once; nor odds appeerd</span>
						<br/>
						<span>In might or swift prevention; but the sword</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of <i>Michael</i> from the Armorie of God</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Was giv’n him temperd so, that neither keen</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Nor solid might resist that edge: it met</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The sword of <i>Satan</i> with steep force to smite</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Descending, and in half cut sheere, nor staid,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>But with swift wheele reverse, deep entring shar’d</span>
						<br/>
						<span>All his right side; then <i>Satan</i> first knew pain,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And writh’d him to and fro convolv’d; so sore</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The griding sword with discontinuous wound</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Pass’d through him, but th’ Ethereal substance clos’d</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Not long divisible, and from the gash</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A stream of Nectarous humor issuing flow’d</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Sanguin, such as Celestial Spirits may bleed,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And all his Armour staind ere while so bright.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Forthwith on all sides to his aide was run</span>
						<br/>
						<span>By Angels many and strong, who interpos’d</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Defence, while others bore him on thir Shields</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Back to his Chariot; where it stood retir’d</span>
						<br/>
						<span>From off the files of warr; there they him laid</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Gnashing for anguish and despite and shame</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To find himself not matchless, and his pride</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Humbl’d by such rebuke, so farr beneath</span>
						<br/>
						<span>His confidence to equal God in power.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Yet soon he heal’d; for Spirits that live throughout</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Vital in every part, not as frail man</span>
						<br/>
						<span>In Entrailes, Heart or Head, Liver or Reines,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Cannot but by annihilating die;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Nor in thir liquid texture mortal wound</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Receive, no more then can the fluid Aire:</span>
						<br/>
						<span>All Heart they live, all Head, all Eye, all Eare,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>All Intellect, all Sense, and as they please,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>They Limb themselves, and colour, shape or size</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Assume, as likes them best, condense or rare.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>Mean while in other parts like deeds deservd</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Memorial, where the might of <i>Gabriel</i> fought,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And with fierce Ensignes pierc’d the deep array</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of <i>Moloc</i> furious King, who him defi’d,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And at his Chariot wheeles to drag him bound</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Threatn’d, nor from the Holie One of Heav’n</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Refrein’d his tongue blasphemous; but anon</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Down clov’n to the waste, with shatterd Armes</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And uncouth paine fled bellowing.  On each wing</span>
						<br/>
						<span><i>Uriel</i> and <i>Raphael</i> his vaunting foe,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Though huge, and in a Rock of Diamond Armd,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Vanquish’d <i>Adramelec</i>, and <i>Asmadai</i>,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Two potent Thrones, that to be less then Gods</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Disdain’d, but meaner thoughts learnd in thir flight,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Mangl’d with gastly wounds through Plate and Maile.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Nor stood unmindful <i>Abdiel</i> to annoy</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The Atheist crew, but with redoubl’d blow</span>
						<br/>
						<span><i>Ariel</i> and <i>Arioc</i>, and the violence</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of <i>Ramiel</i> scorcht and blasted overthrew.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>I might relate of thousands, and thir names</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Eternize here on Earth; but those elect</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Angels contented with thir fame in Heav’n</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Seek not the praise of men: the other sort</span>
						<br/>
						<span>In might though wondrous and in Acts of Warr,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Nor of Renown less eager, yet by doome</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Canceld from Heav’n and sacred memorie,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Nameless in dark oblivion let them dwell.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>For strength from Truth divided and from Just,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Illaudable, naught merits but dispraise</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And ignominie, yet to glorie aspires</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Vain glorious, and through infamie seeks fame:</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Therfore Eternal silence be thir doome.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>And now thir mightiest quelld, the battel swerv’d,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>With many an inrode gor’d; deformed rout</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Enter’d, and foul disorder; all the ground</span>
						<br/>
						<span>With shiverd armour strow’n, and on a heap</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Chariot and Charioter lay overturnd</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And fierie foaming Steeds; what stood, recoyld</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Orewearied, through the faint Satanic Host</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Defensive scarse, or with pale fear surpris’d,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Then first with fear surpris’d and sense of paine</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Fled ignominious, to such evil brought</span>
						<br/>
						<span>By sinne of disobedience, till that hour</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Not liable to fear or flight or paine.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Far otherwise th’ inviolable Saints</span>
						<br/>
						<span>In Cubic Phalanx firm advanc’t entire,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Invulnerable, impenitrably arm’d:</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Such high advantages thir innocence</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Gave them above thir foes, not to have sinnd,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Not to have disobei’d; in fight they stood</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Unwearied, unobnoxious to be pain’d</span>
						<br/>
						<span>By wound, though from thir place by violence mov’d.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>Now Night her course began, and over Heav’n</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Inducing darkness, grateful truce impos’d,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And silence on the odious dinn of Warr:</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Under her Cloudie covert both retir’d,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Victor and Vanquisht: on the foughten field</span>
						<br/>
						<span><i>Michael</i> and his Angels prevalent</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Encamping, plac’d in Guard thir Watches round,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Cherubic waving fires: on th’ other part</span>
						<br/>
						<span><i>Satan</i> with his rebellious disappeerd,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Far in the dark dislodg’d, and void of rest,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>His Potentates to Councel call’d by night;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And in the midst thus undismai’d began.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>O now in danger tri’d, now known in Armes</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Not to be overpowerd, Companions deare,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Found worthy not of Libertie alone,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Too mean pretense, but what we more affect,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Honour, Dominion, Glorie, and renowne,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Who have sustaind one day in doubtful fight,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>(And if one day, why not Eternal dayes?)</span>
						<br/>
						<span>What Heavens Lord had powerfullest to send</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Against us from about his Throne, and judg’d</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Sufficient to subdue us to his will,</span>

						<span>But proves not so: then fallible, it seems,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of future we may deem him, though till now</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Omniscient thought.  True is, less firmly arm’d,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Some disadvantage we endur’d and paine,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Till now not known, but known as soon contemnd,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Since now we find this our Empyreal forme</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Incapable of mortal injurie</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Imperishable, and though peirc’d with wound,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Soon closing, and by native vigour heal’d.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of evil then so small as easie think</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The remedie; perhaps more valid Armes,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Weapons more violent, when next we meet,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>May serve to better us, and worse our foes,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Or equal what between us made the odds,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>In Nature none: if other hidden cause</span>

						<span>Left them Superiour, while we can preserve</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Unhurt our mindes, and understanding sound,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Due search and consultation will disclose.</span>

					<p>
						<span>He sat; and in th’ assembly next upstood</span>
						<br/>
						<span><i>Nisroc</i>, of Principalities the prime;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>As one he stood escap’t from cruel fight,</span>

						<span>Sore toild, his riv’n Armes to havoc hewn,</span>

						<span>And cloudie in aspect thus answering spake.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Deliverer from new Lords, leader to free</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Enjoyment of our right as Gods; yet hard</span>
						<br/>
						<span>For Gods, and too unequal work we find</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Against unequal armes to fight in paine,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Against unpaind, impassive; from which evil</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Ruin must needs ensue; for what availes</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Valour or strength, though matchless, quelld with pain</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Which all subdues, and makes remiss the hands</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of Mightiest.  Sense of pleasure we may well</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Spare out of life perhaps, and not repine,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>But live content, which is the calmest life:</span>
						<br/>
						<span>But pain is perfet miserie, the worst</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of evils, and excessive, overturnes</span>
						<br/>
						<span>All patience.  He who therefore can invent</span>
						<br/>
						<span>With what more forcible we may offend</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Our yet unwounded Enemies, or arme</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Our selves with like defence, to mee deserves</span>

						<span>No less then for deliverance what we owe.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>Whereto with look compos’d <i>Satan</i> repli’d.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Not uninvented that, which thou aright</span>

						<br/>
						<span>Which of us who beholds the bright surface</span>

						<span>Of this Ethereous mould whereon we stand,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>This continent of spacious Heav’n, adornd</span>
						<br/>
						<span>With Plant, Fruit, Flour Ambrosial, Gemms &amp; Gold,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Whose Eye so superficially surveyes</span>
						<br/>
						<span>These things, as not to mind from whence they grow</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Deep under ground, materials dark and crude,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of spiritous and fierie spume, till toucht</span>
						<br/>
						<span>With Heav’ns ray, and temperd they shoot forth</span>
						<br/>
						<span>So beauteous, op’ning to the ambient light.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>These in thir dark Nativitie the Deep</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Shall yeild us, pregnant with infernal flame,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Which into hallow Engins long and round</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Thick-rammd, at th’ other bore with touch of fire</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Dilated and infuriate shall send forth</span>
						<br/>
						<span>From far with thundring noise among our foes</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Such implements of mischief as shall dash</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To pieces, and orewhelm whatever stands</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Adverse, that they shall fear we have disarmd</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The Thunderer of his only dreaded bolt.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Nor long shall be our labour, yet ere dawne,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Effect shall end our wish.  Mean while revive;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Abandon fear; to strength and counsel joind</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Think nothing hard, much less to be despaird.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>He ended, and his words thir drooping chere</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Enlightn’d, and thir languisht hope reviv’d.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Th’ invention all admir’d, and each, how hee</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To be th’ inventer miss’d, so easie it seemd</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Once found, which yet unfound most would have thought</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Impossible: yet haply of thy Race</span>
						<br/>
						<span>In future dayes, if Malice should abound,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Some one intent on mischief, or inspir’d</span>
						<br/>
						<span>With dev’lish machination might devise</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Like instrument to plague the Sons of men</span>
						<br/>
						<span>For sin, on warr and mutual slaughter bent.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Forthwith from Councel to the work they flew,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>None arguing stood, innumerable hands</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Were ready, in a moment up they turnd</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Wide the Celestial soile, and saw beneath</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Th’ originals of Nature in thir crude</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Conception; Sulphurous and Nitrous Foame</span>
						<br/>
						<span>They found, they mingl’d, and with suttle Art,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Concocted and adusted they reduc’d</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To blackest grain, and into store conveyd:</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Part hidd’n veins diggd up (nor hath this Earth</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Entrails unlike) of Mineral and Stone,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Whereof to found thir Engins and thir Balls</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of missive ruin; part incentive reed</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Provide, pernicious with one touch to fire.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>So all ere day spring, under conscious Night</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Secret they finish’d, and in order set,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>With silent circumspection unespi’d.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Now when fair Morn Orient in Heav’n appeerd</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Up rose the Victor Angels, and to Arms</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The matin Trumpet Sung: in Arms they stood</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of Golden Panoplie, refulgent Host,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Soon banded; others from the dawning Hills</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Lookd round, and Scouts each Coast light-armed scoure,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Each quarter, to descrie the distant foe,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Where lodg’d, or whither fled, or if for fight,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>In motion or in alt: him soon they met</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Under spred Ensignes moving nigh, in slow</span>
						<br/>
						<span>But firm Battalion; back with speediest Sail</span>
						<br/>
						<span><i>Zephiel</i>, of Cherubim the swiftest wing,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Came flying, and in mid Aire aloud thus cri’d.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>Arme, Warriours, Arme for fight, the foe at hand,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Whom fled we thought, will save us long pursuit</span>
						<br/>
						<span>This day, fear not his flight; so thick a Cloud</span>
						<br/>
						<span>He comes, and settl’d in his face I see</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Sad resolution and secure: let each</span>
						<br/>
						<span>His Adamantine coat gird well, and each</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Fit well his Helme, gripe fast his orbed Shield,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Born eevn or high, for this day will pour down,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>If I conjecture aught, no drizling showr,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>But ratling storm of Arrows barbd with fire.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>So warnd he them aware themselves, and soon</span>
						<br/>
						<span>In order, quit of all impediment;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Instant without disturb they took Allarm,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And onward move Embattelld; when behold</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Not distant far with heavie pace the Foe</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Approaching gross and huge; in hollow Cube</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Training his devilish Enginrie, impal’d</span>
						<br/>
						<span>On every side with shaddowing Squadrons Deep,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To hide the fraud.  At interview both stood</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A while, but suddenly at head appeerd</span>
						<br/>
						<span><i>Satan</i>: And thus was heard Commanding loud.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>Vangard, to Right and Left the Front unfould;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That all may see who hate us, how we seek</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Peace and composure, and with open brest</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Stand readie to receive them, if they like</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Our overture, and turn not back perverse;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>But that I doubt, however witness Heaven,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Heav’n witness thou anon, while we discharge</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Freely our part: yee who appointed stand</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Do as you have in charge, and briefly touch</span>
						<br/>
						<span>What we propound, and loud that all may hear.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>So scoffing in ambiguous words, he scarce</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Had ended; when to Right and Left the Front</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Divided, and to either Flank retir’d.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Which to our eyes discoverd new and strange,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A triple-mounted row of Pillars laid</span>
						<br/>
						<span>On Wheels (for like to Pillars most they seem’d</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Or hollow’d bodies made of Oak or Firr</span>
						<br/>
						<span>With branches lopt, in Wood or Mountain fell’d)</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Brass, Iron, Stonie mould, had not thir mouthes</span>
						<br/>
						<span>With hideous orifice gap’t on us wide,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Portending hollow truce; at each behind</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A Seraph stood, and in his hand a Reed</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Stood waving tipt with fire; while we suspense,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Collected stood within our thoughts amus’d,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Not long, for sudden all at once thir Reeds</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Put forth, and to a narrow vent appli’d</span>
						<br/>
						<span>With nicest touch.  Immediate in a flame,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>But soon obscur’d with smoak, all Heav’n appeerd,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>From those deep-throated Engins belcht, whose roar</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Emboweld with outragious noise the Air,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And all her entrails tore, disgorging foule</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Thir devillish glut, chaind Thunderbolts and Hail</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of Iron Globes, which on the Victor Host</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Level’d, with such impetuous furie smote,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That whom they hit, none on thir feet might stand,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Though standing else as Rocks, but down they fell</span>
						<br/>
						<span>By thousands, Angel on Arch-Angel rowl’d;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The sooner for thir Arms, unarm’d they might</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Have easily as Spirits evaded swift</span>
						<br/>
						<span>By quick contraction or remove; but now</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Foule dissipation follow’d and forc’t rout;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Nor serv’d it to relax thir serried files.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>What should they do? if on they rusht, repulse</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Repeated, and indecent overthrow</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Doubl’d, would render them yet more despis’d,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And to thir foes a laughter; for in view</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Stood rankt of Seraphim another row</span>
						<br/>
						<span>In posture to displode thir second tire</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of Thunder: back defeated to return</span>
						<br/>
						<span>They worse abhorr’d.  <i>Satan</i> beheld thir plight,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And to his Mates thus in derision call’d.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>O Friends, why come not on these Victors proud?</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Ere while they fierce were coming, and when wee,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To entertain them fair with open Front</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And Brest, (what could we more?) propounded terms</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of composition, strait they chang’d thir minds,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Flew off, and into strange vagaries fell,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>As they would dance, yet for a dance they seemd</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Somwhat extravagant and wilde, perhaps</span>
						<br/>
						<span>For joy of offerd peace: but I suppose</span>
						<br/>
						<span>If our proposals once again were heard</span>
						<br/>
						<span>We should compel them to a quick result.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>To whom thus <i>Belial</i> in like gamesom mood.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Leader, the terms we sent were terms of weight,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of hard contents, and full of force urg’d home,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Such as we might perceive amus’d them all,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And stumbl’d many, who receives them right,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Had need from head to foot well understand;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Not understood, this gift they have besides,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>They shew us when our foes walk not upright.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>So they among themselves in pleasant veine</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Stood scoffing, highthn’d in thir thoughts beyond</span>
						<br/>
						<span>All doubt of Victorie, eternal might</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To match with thir inventions they presum’d</span>
						<br/>
						<span>So easie, and of his Thunder made a scorn,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And all his Host derided, while they stood</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A while in trouble; but they stood not long,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Rage prompted them at length, &amp; found them arms</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Against such hellish mischief fit to oppose.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Forthwith (behold the excellence, the power</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Which God hath in his mighty Angels plac’d)</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Thir Arms away they threw, and to the Hills</span>
						<br/>
						<span>(For Earth hath this variety from Heav’n</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of pleasure situate in Hill and Dale)</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Light as the Lightning glimps they ran, they flew,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>From thir foundations loosning to and fro</span>
						<br/>
						<span>They pluckt the seated Hills with all thir load,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Rocks, Waters, Woods, and by the shaggie tops</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Up lifting bore them in thir hands: Amaze,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Be sure, and terrour seis’d the rebel Host,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>When coming towards them so dread they saw</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The bottom of the Mountains upward turn’d,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Till on those cursed Engins triple-row</span>
						<br/>
						<span>They saw them whelmd, and all thir confidence</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Under the weight of Mountains buried deep,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Themselves invaded next, and on thir heads</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Main Promontories flung, which in the Air</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Came shadowing, and opprest whole Legions arm’d,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Thir armor help’d thir harm, crush’t in and brus’d</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Into thir substance pent, which wrought them pain</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Implacable, and many a dolorous groan,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Long strugling underneath, ere they could wind</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Out of such prison, though Spirits of purest light,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Purest at first, now gross by sinning grown.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The rest in imitation to like Armes</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Betook them, and the neighbouring Hills uptore;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>So Hills amid the Air encounterd Hills</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Hurl’d to and fro with jaculation dire,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That under ground they fought in dismal shade;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Infernal noise; Warr seem’d a civil Game</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To this uproar; horrid confusion heapt</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Upon confusion rose: and now all Heav’n</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Had gone to wrack, with ruin overspred,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Had not th’ Almightie Father where he sits</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Shrin’d in his Sanctuarie of Heav’n secure,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Consulting on the sum of things, foreseen</span>
						<br/>
						<span>This tumult, and permitted all, advis’d:</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That his great purpose he might so fulfill,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To honour his Anointed Son aveng’d</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Upon his enemies, and to declare</span>
						<br/>
						<span>All power on him transferr’d: whence to his Son</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Th’ Assessor of his Throne he thus began.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>Effulgence of my Glorie, Son belov’d,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Son in whose face invisible is beheld</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Visibly, what by Deitie I am,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And in whose hand what by Decree I doe,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Second Omnipotence, two dayes are past,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Two dayes, as we compute the dayes of Heav’n,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Since <i>Michael</i> and his Powers went forth to tame</span>
						<br/>
						<span>These disobedient; sore hath been thir fight,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>As likeliest was, when two such Foes met arm’d;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>For to themselves I left them, and thou knowst,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Equal in their Creation they were form’d,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Save what sin hath impaird, which yet hath wrought</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Insensibly, for I suspend thir doom;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Whence in perpetual fight they needs must last</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Endless, and no solution will be found:</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Warr wearied hath perform’d what Warr can do,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And to disorder’d rage let loose the reines,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>With Mountains as with Weapons arm’d, which makes</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Wild work in Heav’n, and dangerous to the maine.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Two dayes are therefore past, the third is thine;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>For thee I have ordain’d it, and thus farr</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Have sufferd, that the Glorie may be thine</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of ending this great Warr, since none but Thou</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Can end it.  Into thee such Vertue and Grace</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Immense I have transfus’d, that all may know</span>
						<br/>
						<span>In Heav’n and Hell thy Power above compare,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And this perverse Commotion governd thus,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To manifest thee worthiest to be Heir</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of all things, to be Heir and to be King</span>
						<br/>
						<span>By Sacred Unction, thy deserved right.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Go then thou Mightiest in thy Fathers might,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Ascend my Chariot, guide the rapid Wheeles</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That shake Heav’ns basis, bring forth all my Warr,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>My Bow and Thunder, my Almightie Arms</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Gird on, and Sword upon thy puissant Thigh;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Pursue these sons of Darkness, drive them out</span>
						<br/>
						<span>From all Heav’ns bounds into the utter Deep:</span>
						<br/>
						<span>There let them learn, as likes them, to despise</span>
						<br/>
						<span>God and <i>Messiah</i> his anointed King.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>He said, and on his Son with Rayes direct</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Shon full, he all his Father full exprest</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Ineffably into his face receiv’d,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And thus the filial Godhead answering spake.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>O Father, O Supream of heav’nly Thrones,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>First, Highest, Holiest, Best, thou alwayes seekst</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To glorifie thy Son, I alwayes thee,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>As is most just; this I my Glorie account,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>My exaltation, and my whole delight,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That thou in me well pleas’d, declarst thy will</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Fulfill’d, which to fulfil is all my bliss.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Scepter and Power, thy giving, I assume,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And gladlier shall resign, when in the end</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Thou shalt be All in All, and I in thee</span>
						<br/>
						<span>For ever, and in mee all whom thou lov’st:</span>
						<br/>
						<span>But whom thou hat’st, I hate, and can put on</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Thy terrors, as I put thy mildness on,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Image of thee in all things; and shall soon,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Armd with thy might, rid heav’n of these rebell’d,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To thir prepar’d ill Mansion driven down</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To chains of Darkness, and th’ undying Worm,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That from thy just obedience could revolt,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Whom to obey is happiness entire.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Then shall thy Saints unmixt, and from th’ impure</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Farr separate, circling thy holy Mount</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Unfained <i>Halleluiahs</i> to thee sing,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Hymns of high praise, and I among them chief.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>So said, he o’re his Scepter bowing, rose</span>
						<br/>
						<span>From the right hand of Glorie where he sate,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And the third sacred Morn began to shine</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Dawning through Heav’n: forth rush’d with whirlwind sound</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The Chariot of Paternal Deitie,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Flashing thick flames, Wheele within Wheele undrawn,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>It self instinct with Spirit, but convoyd</span>
						<br/>
						<span>By four Cherubic shapes, four Faces each</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Had wondrous, as with Starrs thir bodies all</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And Wings were set with Eyes, with Eyes the Wheels</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of Beril, and careering Fires between;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Over thir heads a chrystal Firmament,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Whereon a Saphir Throne, inlaid with pure</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Amber, and colours of the showrie Arch.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Hee in Celestial Panoplie all armd</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of radiant <i>Urim</i>, work divinely wrought,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Ascended, at his right hand Victorie</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Sate Eagle-wing’d, beside him hung his Bow</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And Quiver with three-bolted Thunder stor’d,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And from about him fierce Effusion rowld</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of smoak and bickering flame, and sparkles dire;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Attended with ten thousand thousand Saints,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>He onward came, farr off his coming shon,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And twentie thousand (I thir number heard)</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Chariots of God, half on each hand were seen:</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Hee on the wings of Cherub rode sublime</span>
						<br/>
						<span>On the Crystallin Skie, in Saphir Thron’d.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Illustrious farr and wide, but by his own</span>
						<br/>
						<span>First seen, them unexpected joy surpriz’d,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>When the great Ensign of <i>Messiah</i> blaz’d</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Aloft by Angels born, his Sign in Heav’n:</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Under whose Conduct <i>Michael</i> soon reduc’d</span>
						<br/>
						<span>His Armie, circumfus’d on either Wing,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Under thir Head imbodied all in one.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Before him Power Divine his way prepar’d;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>At his command the uprooted Hills retir’d</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Each to his place, they heard his voice and went</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Obsequious, Heav’n his wonted face renewd,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And with fresh Flourets Hill and Valley smil’d.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>This saw his hapless Foes, but stood obdur’d,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And to rebellious fight rallied thir Powers</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Insensate, hope conceiving from despair.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>In heav’nly Spirits could such perverseness dwell?</span>
						<br/>
						<span>But to convince the proud what Signs availe,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Or Wonders move th’ obdurate to relent?</span>
						<br/>
						<span>They hard’nd more by what might most reclame,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Grieving to see his Glorie, at the sight</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Took envie, and aspiring to his highth,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Stood reimbattell’d fierce, by force or fraud</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Weening to prosper, and at length prevaile</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Against God and <i>Messiah</i>, or to fall</span>
						<br/>
						<span>In universal ruin last, and now</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To final Battel drew, disdaining flight,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Or faint retreat; when the great Son of God</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To all his Host on either hand thus spake.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>Stand still in bright array ye Saints, here stand</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Ye Angels arm’d, this day from Battel rest;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Faithful hath been your Warfare, and of God</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Accepted, fearless in his righteous Cause,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And as ye have receivd, so have ye don</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Invincibly; but of this cursed crew</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The punishment to other hand belongs,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Vengeance is his, or whose he sole appoints;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Number to this dayes work is not ordain’d</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Nor multitude, stand onely and behold</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Gods indignation on these Godless pourd</span>
						<br/>
						<span>By mee; not you but mee they have despis’d,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Yet envied; against mee is all thir rage,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Because the Father, t’ whom in Heav’n supream</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Kingdom and Power and Glorie appertains,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Hath honourd me according to his will.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Therefore to mee thir doom he hath assig’n’d;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That they may have thir wish, to trie with mee</span>
						<br/>
						<span>In Battel which the stronger proves, they all,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Or I alone against them, since by strength</span>
						<br/>
						<span>They measure all, of other excellence</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Not emulous, nor care who them excells;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Nor other strife with them do I voutsafe.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>So spake the Son, and into terrour chang’d</span>
						<br/>
						<span>His count’nance too severe to be beheld</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And full of wrauth bent on his Enemies.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>At once the Four spred out thir Starrie wings</span>
						<br/>
						<span>With dreadful shade contiguous, and the Orbes</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of his fierce Chariot rowld, as with the sound</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of torrent Floods, or of a numerous Host.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Hee on his impious Foes right onward drove,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Gloomie as Night; under his burning Wheeles</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The stedfast Empyrean shook throughout,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>All but the Throne it self of God.  Full soon</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Among them he arriv’d; in his right hand</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Grasping ten thousand Thunders, which he sent</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Before him, such as in thir Soules infix’d</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Plagues; they astonisht all resistance lost,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>All courage; down thir idle weapons drop’d;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>O’re Shields and Helmes, and helmed heads he rode</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of Thrones and mighty Seraphim prostrate,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That wish’d the Mountains now might be again</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Thrown on them as a shelter from his ire.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Nor less on either side tempestuous fell</span>
						<br/>
						<span>His arrows, from the fourfold-visag’d Foure,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Distinct with eyes, and from the living Wheels,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Distinct alike with multitude of eyes,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>One Spirit in them rul’d, and every eye</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Glar’d lightning, and shot forth pernicious fire</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Among th’ accurst, that witherd all thir strength,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And of thir wonted vigour left them draind,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Exhausted, spiritless, afflicted, fall’n.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Yet half his strength he put not forth, but check’d</span>
						<br/>
						<span>His Thunder in mid Volie, for he meant</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Not to destroy, but root them out of Heav’n:</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The overthrown he rais’d, and as a Heard</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of Goats or timerous flock together throngd</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Drove them before him Thunder-struck, pursu’d</span>
						<br/>
						<span>With terrors and with furies to the bounds</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And Chrystall wall of Heav’n, which op’ning wide,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Rowld inward, and a spacious Gap disclos’d</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Into the wastful Deep; the monstrous sight</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Strook them with horror backward, but far worse</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Urg’d them behind; headlong themselvs they threw</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Down from the verge of Heav’n, Eternal wrauth</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Burnt after them to the bottomless pit.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>Hell heard th’ unsufferable noise, Hell saw</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Heav’n ruining from Heav’n and would have fled</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Affrighted; but strict Fate had cast too deep</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Her dark foundations, and too fast had bound.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Nine dayes they fell; confounded <i>Chaos</i> roard,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And felt tenfold confusion in thir fall</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Through his wilde Anarchie, so huge a rout</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Incumberd him with ruin: Hell at last</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Yawning receavd them whole, and on them clos’d,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Hell thir fit habitation fraught with fire</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Unquenchable, the house of woe and paine.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Disburd’nd Heav’n rejoic’d, and soon repaird</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Her mural breach, returning whence it rowld.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Sole Victor from th’ expulsion of his Foes</span>
						<br/>
						<span><i>Messiah</i> his triumphal Chariot turnd:</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To meet him all his Saints, who silent stood</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Eye witnesses of his Almightie Acts,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>With Jubilie advanc’d; and as they went,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Shaded with branching Palme, each order bright,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Sung Triumph, and him sung Victorious King,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Son, Heire, and Lord, to him Dominion giv’n,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Worthiest to Reign: he celebrated rode</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Triumphant through mid Heav’n, into the Courts</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And Temple of his mightie Father Thron’d</span>
						<br/>
						<span>On high; who into Glorie him receav’d,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Where now he sits at the right hand of bliss.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>Thus measuring things in Heav’n by things on Earth</span>
						<br/>
						<span>At thy request, and that thou maist beware</span>
						<br/>
						<span>By what is past, to thee I have reveal’d</span>
						<br/>
						<span>What might have else to human Race bin hid;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The discord which befel, and Warr in Heav’n</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Among th’ Angelic Powers, and the deep fall</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of those too high aspiring, who rebelld</span>
						<br/>
						<span>With <i>Satan</i>, hee who envies now thy state,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Who now is plotting how he may seduce</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Thee also from obedience, that with him</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Bereavd of happiness thou maist partake</span>
						<br/>
						<span>His punishment, Eternal miserie;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Which would be all his solace and revenge,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>As a despite don against the most High,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Thee once to gaine Companion of his woe.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>But list’n not to his Temptations, warne</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Thy weaker; let it profit thee to have heard</span>
						<br/>
						<span>By terrible Example the reward</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of disobedience; firm they might have stood,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Yet fell; remember, and fear to transgress.</span>
