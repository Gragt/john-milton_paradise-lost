<p class="pfirst">
All night the dreadless Angel unpursu’d<br/>
Through Heav’ns wide Champain held his way, till Morn,<br/>
Wak’t by the circling Hours, with rosie hand<br/>
Unbarr’d the gates of Light.  There is a Cave<br/>
Within the Mount of God, fast by his Throne,<br/>
Where light and darkness in perpetual round<br/>
Lodge and dislodge by turns, which makes through Heav’n<br/>
Grateful vicissitude, like Day and Night;<br/>
Light issues forth, and at the other dore<br/>
Obsequious darkness enters, till her houre<br/>
To veile the Heav’n, though darkness there might well<br/>
Seem twilight here; and now went forth the Morn<br/>
Such as in highest Heav’n, arrayd in Gold<br/>
Empyreal, from before her vanisht Night,<br/>
Shot through with orient Beams: when all the Plain<br/>
Coverd with thick embatteld Squadrons bright,<br/>
Chariots and flaming Armes, and fierie Steeds<br/>
Reflecting blaze on blaze, first met his view:<br/>
Warr he perceav’d, warr in procinct, and found<br/>
Already known what he for news had thought<br/>
To have reported: gladly then he mixt<br/>
Among those friendly Powers who him receav’d<br/>
With joy and acclamations loud, that one<br/>
That of so many Myriads fall’n, yet one<br/>
Returnd not lost: On to the sacred hill<br/>
They led him high applauded, and present<br/>
Before the seat supream; from whence a voice<br/>
From midst a Golden Cloud thus milde was heard.<br/>
</p>
<p class="poem">
Servant of God, well done, well hast thou fought<br/>
The better fight, who single hast maintaind<br/>
Against revolted multitudes the Cause<br/>
Of Truth, in word mightier then they in Armes;<br/>
And for the testimonie of Truth hast born<br/>
Universal reproach, far worse to beare<br/>
Then violence: for this was all thy care<br/>
To stand approv’d in sight of God, though Worlds<br/>
Judg’d thee perverse: the easier conquest now<br/>
Remains thee, aided by this host of friends,<br/>
Back on thy foes more glorious to return<br/>
Then scornd thou didst depart, and to subdue<br/>
By force, who reason for thir Law refuse,<br/>
Right reason for thir Law, and for thir King<br/>
<i>Messiah</i>, who by right of merit Reigns.<br/>
Goe <i>Michael</i> of Celestial Armies Prince,<br/>
And thou in Military prowess next<br/>
<i>Gabriel</i>, lead forth to Battel these my Sons<br/>
Invincible, lead forth my armed Saints<br/>
By Thousands and by Millions rang’d for fight;<br/>
Equal in number to that Godless crew<br/>
Rebellious, them with Fire and hostile Arms<br/>
Fearless assault, and to the brow of Heav’n<br/>
Pursuing drive them out from God and bliss,<br/>
Into thir place of punishment, the Gulf<br/>
Of <i>Tartarus</i>, which ready opens wide<br/>
His fiery <i>Chaos</i> to receave thir fall.<br/>
</p>
<p class="poem">
So spake the Sovran voice, and Clouds began<br/>
To darken all the Hill, and smoak to rowl<br/>
In duskie wreathes, reluctant flames, the signe<br/>
Of wrauth awak’t: nor with less dread the loud<br/>
Ethereal Trumpet from on high gan blow:<br/>
At which command the Powers Militant,<br/>
That stood for Heav’n, in mighty Quadrate joyn’d<br/>
Of Union irresistible, mov’d on<br/>
In silence thir bright Legions, to the sound<br/>
Of instrumental Harmonie that breath’d<br/>
Heroic Ardor to advent’rous deeds<br/>
Under thir God-like Leaders, in the Cause<br/>
Of God and his <i>Messiah</i>.  On they move<br/>
Indissolubly firm; nor obvious Hill,<br/>
Nor streit’ning Vale, nor Wood, nor Stream divides<br/>
Thir perfet ranks; for high above the ground<br/>
Thir march was, and the passive Air upbore<br/>
Thir nimble tread; as when the total kind<br/>
Of Birds in orderly array on wing<br/>
Came summond over <i>Eden</i> to receive<br/>
Thir names of thee; so over many a tract<br/>
Of Heav’n they march’d, and many a Province wide<br/>
Tenfold the length of this terrene: at last<br/>
Farr in th’ Horizon to the North appeer’d<br/>
From skirt to skirt a fierie Region, stretcht<br/>
In battailous aspect, and neerer view<br/>
Bristl’d with upright beams innumerable<br/>
Of rigid Spears, and Helmets throng’d, and Shields<br/>
Various, with boastful Argument portraid,<br/>
The banded Powers of <i>Satan</i> hasting on<br/>
With furious expedition; for they weend<br/>
That self same day by fight, or by surprize<br/>
To win the Mount of God, and on his Throne<br/>
To set the envier of his State, the proud<br/>
Aspirer, but thir thoughts prov’d fond and vain<br/>
In the mid way: though strange to us it seemd<br/>
At first, that Angel should with Angel warr,<br/>
And in fierce hosting meet, who wont to meet<br/>
So oft in Festivals of joy and love<br/>
Unanimous, as sons of one great Sire<br/>
Hymning th’ Eternal Father: but the shout<br/>
Of Battel now began, and rushing sound<br/>
Of onset ended soon each milder thought.<br/>
High in the midst exalted as a God<br/>
Th’ Apostat in his Sun-bright Chariot sate<br/>
Idol of Majestie Divine, enclos’d<br/>
With Flaming Cherubim, and golden Shields;<br/>
Then lighted from his gorgeous Throne, for now<br/>
’Twixt Host and Host but narrow space was left,<br/>
A dreadful interval, and Front to Front<br/>
Presented stood in terrible array<br/>
Of hideous length: before the cloudie Van,<br/>
On the rough edge of battel ere it joyn’d,<br/>
<i>Satan</i> with vast and haughtie strides advanc’t,<br/>
Came towring, armd in Adamant and Gold;<br/>
<i>Abdiel</i> that sight endur’d not, where he stood<br/>
Among the mightiest, bent on highest deeds,<br/>
And thus his own undaunted heart explores.<br/>
</p>
<p class="poem">
O Heav’n! that such resemblance of the Highest<br/>
Should yet remain, where faith and realtie<br/>
Remain not; wherfore should not strength &amp; might<br/>
There fail where Vertue fails, or weakest prove<br/>
Where boldest; though to sight unconquerable?<br/>
His puissance, trusting in th’ Almightie’s aide,<br/>
I mean to try, whose Reason I have tri’d<br/>
Unsound and false; nor is it aught but just,<br/>
That he who in debate of Truth hath won,<br/>
Should win in Arms, in both disputes alike<br/>
Victor; though brutish that contest and foule,<br/>
When Reason hath to deal with force, yet so<br/>
Most reason is that Reason overcome.<br/>
</p>
<p class="poem">
So pondering, and from his armed Peers<br/>
Forth stepping opposite, half way he met<br/>
His daring foe, at this prevention more<br/>
Incens’t, and thus securely him defi’d.<br/>
</p>
<p class="poem">
Proud, art thou met? thy hope was to have reacht<br/>
The highth of thy aspiring unoppos’d,<br/>
The Throne of God unguarded, and his side<br/>
Abandond at the terror of thy Power<br/>
Or potent tongue; fool, not to think how vain<br/>
Against th’ Omnipotent to rise in Arms;<br/>
Who out of smallest things could without end<br/>
Have rais’d incessant Armies to defeat<br/>
Thy folly; or with solitarie hand<br/>
Reaching beyond all limit, at one blow<br/>
Unaided could have finisht thee, and whelmd<br/>
Thy Legions under darkness; but thou seest<br/>
All are not of thy Train; there be who Faith<br/>
Prefer, and Pietie to God, though then<br/>
To thee not visible, when I alone<br/>
Seemd in thy World erroneous to dissent<br/>
From all: my Sect thou seest, now learn too late<br/>
How few somtimes may know, when thousands err.<br/>
</p>
<p class="poem">
  Whom the grand foe with scornful eye askance<br/>
Thus answerd.  Ill for thee, but in wisht houre<br/>
Of my revenge, first sought for thou returnst<br/>
From flight, seditious Angel, to receave<br/>
Thy merited reward, the first assay<br/>
Of this right hand provok’t, since first that tongue<br/>
Inspir’d with contradiction durst oppose<br/>
A third part of the Gods, in Synod met<br/>
Thir Deities to assert, who while they feel<br/>
Vigour Divine within them, can allow<br/>
Omnipotence to none.  But well thou comst<br/>
Before thy fellows, ambitious to win<br/>
From me som Plume, that thy success may show<br/>
Destruction to the rest: this pause between<br/>
(Unanswerd least thou boast) to let thee know;<br/>
At first I thought that Libertie and Heav’n<br/>
To heav’nly Soules had bin all one; but now<br/>
I see that most through sloth had rather serve,<br/>
Ministring Spirits, traind up in Feast and Song;<br/>
Such hast thou arm’d, the Minstrelsie of Heav’n,<br/>
Servilitie with freedom to contend,<br/>
As both thir deeds compar’d this day shall prove.<br/>
</p>
<p class="poem">
To whom in brief thus <i>Abdiel</i> stern repli’d.<br/>
Apostat, still thou errst, nor end wilt find<br/>
Of erring, from the path of truth remote:<br/>
Unjustly thou deprav’st it with the name<br/>
Of <i>Servitude</i> to serve whom God ordains,<br/>
Or Nature; God and Nature bid the same,<br/>
When he who rules is worthiest, and excells<br/>
Them whom he governs.  This is servitude,<br/>
To serve th’ unwise, or him who hath rebelld<br/>
Against his worthier, as thine now serve thee,<br/>
Thy self not free, but to thy self enthrall’d;<br/>
Yet leudly dar’st our ministring upbraid.<br/>
Reign thou in Hell thy Kingdom, let mee serve<br/>
In Heav’n God ever blessed, and his Divine<br/>
Behests obey, worthiest to be obey’d,<br/>
Yet Chains in Hell, not Realms expect: mean while<br/>
From mee returnd, as erst thou saidst, from flight,<br/>
This greeting on thy impious Crest receive.<br/>
</p>
<p class="poem">
So saying, a noble stroke he lifted high,<br/>
Which hung not, but so swift with tempest fell<br/>
On the proud Crest of <i>Satan</i>, that no sight,<br/>
Nor motion of swift thought, less could his Shield<br/>
Such ruin intercept: ten paces huge<br/>
He back recoild; the tenth on bended knee<br/>
His massie Spear upstaid; as if on Earth<br/>
Winds under ground or waters forcing way<br/>
Sidelong, had push’t a Mountain from his seat<br/>
Half sunk with all his Pines.  Amazement seis’d<br/>
The Rebel Thrones, but greater rage to see<br/>
Thus foil’d thir mightiest, ours joy filld, and shout,<br/>
Presage of Victorie and fierce desire<br/>
Of Battel: whereat <i>Michael</i> bid sound<br/>
Th’ Arch-Angel trumpet; through the vast of Heav’n<br/>
It sounded, and the faithful Armies rung<br/>
<i>Hosanna</i> to the Highest: nor stood at gaze<br/>
The adverse Legions, nor less hideous joyn’d<br/>
The horrid shock: now storming furie rose,<br/>
And clamour such as heard in Heav’n till now<br/>
Was never, Arms on Armour clashing bray’d<br/>
Horrible discord, and the madding Wheeles<br/>
Of brazen Chariots rag’d; dire was the noise<br/>
Of conflict; over head the dismal hiss<br/>
Of fiery Darts in flaming volies flew,<br/>
And flying vaulted either Host with fire.<br/>
Sounder fierie Cope together rush’d<br/>
Both Battels maine, with ruinous assault<br/>
And inextinguishable rage; all Heav’n<br/>
Resounded, and had Earth bin then, all Earth<br/>
Had to her Center shook.  What wonder? when<br/>
Millions of fierce encountring Angels fought<br/>
On either side, the least of whom could weild<br/>
These Elements, and arm him with the force<br/>
Of all thir Regions: how much more of Power<br/>
Armie against Armie numberless to raise<br/>
Dreadful combustion warring, and disturb,<br/>
Though not destroy, thir happie Native seat;<br/>
Had not th’ Eternal King Omnipotent<br/>
From his strong hold of Heav’n high over-rul’d<br/>
And limited thir might; though numberd such<br/>
As each divided Legion might have seemd<br/>
A numerous Host, in strength each armed hand<br/>
A Legion; led in fight, yet Leader seemd<br/>
Each Warriour single as in Chief, expert<br/>
When to advance, or stand, or turn the sway<br/>
Of Battel, open when, and when to close<br/>
The ridges of grim Warr; no thought of flight,<br/>
None of retreat, no unbecoming deed<br/>
That argu’d fear; each on himself reli’d,<br/>
As onely in his arm the moment lay<br/>
Of victorie; deeds of eternal fame<br/>
Were don, but infinite: for wide was spred<br/>
That Warr and various; somtimes on firm ground<br/>
A standing fight, then soaring on main wing<br/>
Tormented all the Air; all Air seemd then<br/>
Conflicting Fire: long time in eeven scale<br/>
The Battel hung; till <i>Satan</i>, who that day<br/>
Prodigious power had shewn, and met in Armes<br/>
No equal, raunging through the dire attack<br/>
Of fighting Seraphim confus’d, at length<br/>
Saw where the Sword of <i>Michael</i> smote, and fell’d<br/>
Squadrons at once, with huge two-handed sway<br/>
Brandisht aloft the horrid edge came down<br/>
Wide wasting; such destruction to withstand<br/>
He hasted, and oppos’d the rockie Orb<br/>
Of tenfold Adamant, his ample Shield<br/>
A vast circumference: At his approach<br/>
The great Arch-Angel from his warlike toile<br/>
Surceas’d, and glad as hoping here to end<br/>
Intestine War in Heav’n, the arch foe subdu’d<br/>
Or Captive drag’d in Chains, with hostile frown<br/>
And visage all enflam’d first thus began.<br/>
</p>
<p class="poem">
Author of evil, unknown till thy revolt,<br/>
Unnam’d in Heav’n, now plenteous, as thou seest<br/>
These Acts of hateful strife, hateful to all,<br/>
Though heaviest by just measure on thy self<br/>
And thy adherents: how hast thou disturb’d<br/>
Heav’ns blessed peace, and into Nature brought<br/>
Miserie, uncreated till the crime<br/>
Of thy Rebellion? how hast thou instill’d<br/>
Thy malice into thousands, once upright<br/>
And faithful, now prov’d false.  But think not here<br/>
To trouble Holy Rest; Heav’n casts thee out<br/>
From all her Confines.  Heav’n the seat of bliss<br/>
Brooks not the works of violence and Warr.<br/>
Hence then, and evil go with thee along<br/>
Thy ofspring, to the place of evil, Hell,<br/>
Thou and thy wicked crew; there mingle broiles,<br/>
Ere this avenging Sword begin thy doome,<br/>
Or som more sudden vengeance wing’d from God<br/>
Precipitate thee with augmented paine.<br/>
</p>
<p class="poem">
So spake the Prince of Angels; to whom thus<br/>
The Adversarie.  Nor think thou with wind<br/>
Of airie threats to aw whom yet with deeds<br/>
Thou canst not.  Hast thou turnd the least of these<br/>
To flight, or if to fall, but that they rise<br/>
Unvanquisht, easier to transact with mee<br/>
That thou shouldst hope, imperious, &amp; with threats<br/>
To chase me hence? erre not that so shall end<br/>
The strife which thou call’st evil, but wee style<br/>
The strife of Glorie: which we mean to win,<br/>
Or turn this Heav’n it self into the Hell<br/>
Thou fablest, here however to dwell free,<br/>
If not to reign: mean while thy utmost force,<br/>
And join him nam’d <i>Almightie</i> to thy aid,<br/>
I flie not, but have sought thee farr and nigh.<br/>
</p>
<p class="poem">
They ended parle, and both addrest for fight<br/>
Unspeakable; for who, though with the tongue<br/>
Of Angels, can relate, or to what things<br/>
Liken on Earth conspicuous, that may lift<br/>
Human imagination to such highth<br/>
Of Godlike Power: for likest Gods they seemd,<br/>
Stood they or mov’d, in stature, motion, arms<br/>
Fit to decide the Empire of great Heav’n.<br/>
Now wav’d thir fierie Swords, and in the Aire<br/>
Made horrid Circles; two broad Suns thir Shields<br/>
Blaz’d opposite, while expectation stood<br/>
In horror; from each hand with speed retir’d<br/>
Where erst was thickest fight, th’ Angelic throng,<br/>
And left large field, unsafe within the wind<br/>
Of such commotion, such as to set forth<br/>
Great things by small, If Natures concord broke,<br/>
Among the Constellations warr were sprung,<br/>
Two Planets rushing from aspect maligne<br/>
Of fiercest opposition in mid Skie,<br/>
Should combat, and thir jarring Sphears confound.<br/>
Together both with next to Almightie Arme,<br/>
Uplifted imminent one stroke they aim’d<br/>
That might determine, and not need repeate,<br/>
As not of power, at once; nor odds appeerd<br/>
In might or swift prevention; but the sword<br/>
Of <i>Michael</i> from the Armorie of God<br/>
Was giv’n him temperd so, that neither keen<br/>
Nor solid might resist that edge: it met<br/>
The sword of <i>Satan</i> with steep force to smite<br/>
Descending, and in half cut sheere, nor staid,<br/>
But with swift wheele reverse, deep entring shar’d<br/>
All his right side; then <i>Satan</i> first knew pain,<br/>
And writh’d him to and fro convolv’d; so sore<br/>
The griding sword with discontinuous wound<br/>
Pass’d through him, but th’ Ethereal substance clos’d<br/>
Not long divisible, and from the gash<br/>
A stream of Nectarous humor issuing flow’d<br/>
Sanguin, such as Celestial Spirits may bleed,<br/>
And all his Armour staind ere while so bright.<br/>
Forthwith on all sides to his aide was run<br/>
By Angels many and strong, who interpos’d<br/>
Defence, while others bore him on thir Shields<br/>
Back to his Chariot; where it stood retir’d<br/>
From off the files of warr; there they him laid<br/>
Gnashing for anguish and despite and shame<br/>
To find himself not matchless, and his pride<br/>
Humbl’d by such rebuke, so farr beneath<br/>
His confidence to equal God in power.<br/>
Yet soon he heal’d; for Spirits that live throughout<br/>
Vital in every part, not as frail man<br/>
In Entrailes, Heart or Head, Liver or Reines,<br/>
Cannot but by annihilating die;<br/>
Nor in thir liquid texture mortal wound<br/>
Receive, no more then can the fluid Aire:<br/>
All Heart they live, all Head, all Eye, all Eare,<br/>
All Intellect, all Sense, and as they please,<br/>
They Limb themselves, and colour, shape or size<br/>
Assume, as likes them best, condense or rare.<br/>
</p>
<p class="poem">
Mean while in other parts like deeds deservd<br/>
Memorial, where the might of <i>Gabriel</i> fought,<br/>
And with fierce Ensignes pierc’d the deep array<br/>
Of <i>Moloc</i> furious King, who him defi’d,<br/>
And at his Chariot wheeles to drag him bound<br/>
Threatn’d, nor from the Holie One of Heav’n<br/>
Refrein’d his tongue blasphemous; but anon<br/>
Down clov’n to the waste, with shatterd Armes<br/>
And uncouth paine fled bellowing.  On each wing<br/>
<i>Uriel</i> and <i>Raphael</i> his vaunting foe,<br/>
Though huge, and in a Rock of Diamond Armd,<br/>
Vanquish’d <i>Adramelec</i>, and <i>Asmadai</i>,<br/>
Two potent Thrones, that to be less then Gods<br/>
Disdain’d, but meaner thoughts learnd in thir flight,<br/>
Mangl’d with gastly wounds through Plate and Maile.<br/>
Nor stood unmindful <i>Abdiel</i> to annoy<br/>
The Atheist crew, but with redoubl’d blow<br/>
<i>Ariel</i> and <i>Arioc</i>, and the violence<br/>
Of <i>Ramiel</i> scorcht and blasted overthrew.<br/>
I might relate of thousands, and thir names<br/>
Eternize here on Earth; but those elect<br/>
Angels contented with thir fame in Heav’n<br/>
Seek not the praise of men: the other sort<br/>
In might though wondrous and in Acts of Warr,<br/>
Nor of Renown less eager, yet by doome<br/>
Canceld from Heav’n and sacred memorie,<br/>
Nameless in dark oblivion let them dwell.<br/>
For strength from Truth divided and from Just,<br/>
Illaudable, naught merits but dispraise<br/>
And ignominie, yet to glorie aspires<br/>
Vain glorious, and through infamie seeks fame:<br/>
Therfore Eternal silence be thir doome.<br/>

And now thir mightiest quelld, the battel swerv’d,<br/>

And fierie foaming Steeds; what stood, recoyld<br/>
Orewearied, through the faint Satanic Host<br/>

Invulnerable, impenitrably arm’d:<br/>

Some one intent on mischief, or inspir’d<br/>
With dev’lish machination might devise<br/>
Like instrument to plague the Sons of men<br/>
For sin, on warr and mutual slaughter bent.<br/>
Forthwith from Councel to the work they flew,<br/>
None arguing stood, innumerable hands<br/>
Were ready, in a moment up they turnd<br/>
Wide the Celestial soile, and saw beneath<br/>
Th’ originals of Nature in thir crude<br/>
Conception; Sulphurous and Nitrous Foame<br/>
They found, they mingl’d, and with suttle Art,<br/>
Concocted and adusted they reduc’d<br/>
To blackest grain, and into store conveyd:<br/>
Part hidd’n veins diggd up (nor hath this Earth<br/>
Entrails unlike) of Mineral and Stone,<br/>
Whereof to found thir Engins and thir Balls<br/>
Of missive ruin; part incentive reed<br/>
Provide, pernicious with one touch to fire.<br/>
So all ere day spring, under conscious Night<br/>
Secret they finish’d, and in order set,<br/>
With silent circumspection unespi’d.<br/>
Now when fair Morn Orient in Heav’n appeerd<br/>
Up rose the Victor Angels, and to Arms<br/>
The matin Trumpet Sung: in Arms they stood<br/>
Of Golden Panoplie, refulgent Host,<br/>
Soon banded; others from the dawning Hills<br/>
Lookd round, and Scouts each Coast light-armed scoure,<br/>
Each quarter, to descrie the distant foe,<br/>
Where lodg’d, or whither fled, or if for fight,<br/>
In motion or in alt: him soon they met<br/>
Under spred Ensignes moving nigh, in slow<br/>
But firm Battalion; back with speediest Sail<br/>
<i>Zephiel</i>, of Cherubim the swiftest wing,<br/>
Came flying, and in mid Aire aloud thus cri’d.<br/>
</p>
<p class="poem">
Arme, Warriours, Arme for fight, the foe at hand,<br/>
Whom fled we thought, will save us long pursuit<br/>
This day, fear not his flight; so thick a Cloud<br/>
He comes, and settl’d in his face I see<br/>
Sad resolution and secure: let each<br/>
His Adamantine coat gird well, and each<br/>
Fit well his Helme, gripe fast his orbed Shield,<br/>
Born eevn or high, for this day will pour down,<br/>
If I conjecture aught, no drizling showr,<br/>
But ratling storm of Arrows barbd with fire.<br/>
So warnd he them aware themselves, and soon<br/>
In order, quit of all impediment;<br/>
Instant without disturb they took Allarm,<br/>
And onward move Embattelld; when behold<br/>
Not distant far with heavie pace the Foe<br/>
Approaching gross and huge; in hollow Cube<br/>
Training his devilish Enginrie, impal’d<br/>
On every side with shaddowing Squadrons Deep,<br/>
To hide the fraud.  At interview both stood<br/>
A while, but suddenly at head appeerd<br/>
<i>Satan</i>: And thus was heard Commanding loud.<br/>
</p>
<p class="poem">
Vangard, to Right and Left the Front unfould;<br/>
That all may see who hate us, how we seek<br/>
Peace and composure, and with open brest<br/>
Stand readie to receive them, if they like<br/>
Our overture, and turn not back perverse;<br/>
But that I doubt, however witness Heaven,<br/>
Heav’n witness thou anon, while we discharge<br/>
Freely our part: yee who appointed stand<br/>
Do as you have in charge, and briefly touch<br/>
What we propound, and loud that all may hear.<br/>
</p>
<p class="poem">
So scoffing in ambiguous words, he scarce<br/>
Had ended; when to Right and Left the Front<br/>
Divided, and to either Flank retir’d.<br/>
Which to our eyes discoverd new and strange,<br/>
A triple-mounted row of Pillars laid<br/>
On Wheels (for like to Pillars most they seem’d<br/>
Or hollow’d bodies made of Oak or Firr<br/>
With branches lopt, in Wood or Mountain fell’d)<br/>
Brass, Iron, Stonie mould, had not thir mouthes<br/>
With hideous orifice gap’t on us wide,<br/>
Portending hollow truce; at each behind<br/>
A Seraph stood, and in his hand a Reed<br/>
Stood waving tipt with fire; while we suspense,<br/>
Collected stood within our thoughts amus’d,<br/>
Not long, for sudden all at once thir Reeds<br/>
Put forth, and to a narrow vent appli’d<br/>
With nicest touch.  Immediate in a flame,<br/>
But soon obscur’d with smoak, all Heav’n appeerd,<br/>
From those deep-throated Engins belcht, whose roar<br/>
Emboweld with outragious noise the Air,<br/>
And all her entrails tore, disgorging foule<br/>
Thir devillish glut, chaind Thunderbolts and Hail<br/>
Of Iron Globes, which on the Victor Host<br/>
Level’d, with such impetuous furie smote,<br/>
That whom they hit, none on thir feet might stand,<br/>
Though standing else as Rocks, but down they fell<br/>
By thousands, Angel on Arch-Angel rowl’d;<br/>
The sooner for thir Arms, unarm’d they might<br/>
Have easily as Spirits evaded swift<br/>
By quick contraction or remove; but now<br/>
Foule dissipation follow’d and forc’t rout;<br/>
Nor serv’d it to relax thir serried files.<br/>
What should they do? if on they rusht, repulse<br/>
Repeated, and indecent overthrow<br/>
Doubl’d, would render them yet more despis’d,<br/>
And to thir foes a laughter; for in view<br/>
Stood rankt of Seraphim another row<br/>
In posture to displode thir second tire<br/>
Of Thunder: back defeated to return<br/>
They worse abhorr’d.  <i>Satan</i> beheld thir plight,<br/>
And to his Mates thus in derision call’d.<br/>
</p>
<p class="poem">
O Friends, why come not on these Victors proud?<br/>
Ere while they fierce were coming, and when wee,<br/>
To entertain them fair with open Front<br/>
And Brest, (what could we more?) propounded terms<br/>
Of composition, strait they chang’d thir minds,<br/>
Flew off, and into strange vagaries fell,<br/>
As they would dance, yet for a dance they seemd<br/>
Somwhat extravagant and wilde, perhaps<br/>
For joy of offerd peace: but I suppose<br/>
If our proposals once again were heard<br/>
We should compel them to a quick result.<br/>
</p>
<p class="poem">
To whom thus <i>Belial</i> in like gamesom mood.<br/>
Leader, the terms we sent were terms of weight,<br/>
Of hard contents, and full of force urg’d home,<br/>
Such as we might perceive amus’d them all,<br/>
And stumbl’d many, who receives them right,<br/>
Had need from head to foot well understand;<br/>
Not understood, this gift they have besides,<br/>
They shew us when our foes walk not upright.<br/>
</p>
<p class="poem">
So they among themselves in pleasant veine<br/>
Stood scoffing, highthn’d in thir thoughts beyond<br/>
All doubt of Victorie, eternal might<br/>
To match with thir inventions they presum’d<br/>
So easie, and of his Thunder made a scorn,<br/>
And all his Host derided, while they stood<br/>
A while in trouble; but they stood not long,<br/>
Rage prompted them at length, &amp; found them arms<br/>
Against such hellish mischief fit to oppose.<br/>
Forthwith (behold the excellence, the power<br/>
Which God hath in his mighty Angels plac’d)<br/>
Thir Arms away they threw, and to the Hills<br/>
(For Earth hath this variety from Heav’n<br/>
Of pleasure situate in Hill and Dale)<br/>
Light as the Lightning glimps they ran, they flew,<br/>
From thir foundations loosning to and fro<br/>
They pluckt the seated Hills with all thir load,<br/>
Rocks, Waters, Woods, and by the shaggie tops<br/>
Up lifting bore them in thir hands: Amaze,<br/>
Be sure, and terrour seis’d the rebel Host,<br/>
When coming towards them so dread they saw<br/>
The bottom of the Mountains upward turn’d,<br/>
Till on those cursed Engins triple-row<br/>
They saw them whelmd, and all thir confidence<br/>
Under the weight of Mountains buried deep,<br/>
Themselves invaded next, and on thir heads<br/>
Main Promontories flung, which in the Air<br/>
Came shadowing, and opprest whole Legions arm’d,<br/>
Thir armor help’d thir harm, crush’t in and brus’d<br/>
Into thir substance pent, which wrought them pain<br/>
Implacable, and many a dolorous groan,<br/>
Long strugling underneath, ere they could wind<br/>
Out of such prison, though Spirits of purest light,<br/>
Purest at first, now gross by sinning grown.<br/>
The rest in imitation to like Armes<br/>
Betook them, and the neighbouring Hills uptore;<br/>
So Hills amid the Air encounterd Hills<br/>
Hurl’d to and fro with jaculation dire,<br/>
That under ground they fought in dismal shade;<br/>
Infernal noise; Warr seem’d a civil Game<br/>
To this uproar; horrid confusion heapt<br/>
Upon confusion rose: and now all Heav’n<br/>
Had gone to wrack, with ruin overspred,<br/>
Had not th’ Almightie Father where he sits<br/>
Shrin’d in his Sanctuarie of Heav’n secure,<br/>
Consulting on the sum of things, foreseen<br/>
This tumult, and permitted all, advis’d:<br/>
That his great purpose he might so fulfill,<br/>
To honour his Anointed Son aveng’d<br/>
Upon his enemies, and to declare<br/>
All power on him transferr’d: whence to his Son<br/>
Th’ Assessor of his Throne he thus began.<br/>
</p>
<p class="poem">
Effulgence of my Glorie, Son belov’d,<br/>
Son in whose face invisible is beheld<br/>
Visibly, what by Deitie I am,<br/>
And in whose hand what by Decree I doe,<br/>
Second Omnipotence, two dayes are past,<br/>
Two dayes, as we compute the dayes of Heav’n,<br/>
Since <i>Michael</i> and his Powers went forth to tame<br/>
These disobedient; sore hath been thir fight,<br/>
As likeliest was, when two such Foes met arm’d;<br/>
For to themselves I left them, and thou knowst,<br/>
Equal in their Creation they were form’d,<br/>
Save what sin hath impaird, which yet hath wrought<br/>
Insensibly, for I suspend thir doom;<br/>
Whence in perpetual fight they needs must last<br/>
Endless, and no solution will be found:<br/>
Warr wearied hath perform’d what Warr can do,<br/>
And to disorder’d rage let loose the reines,<br/>
With Mountains as with Weapons arm’d, which makes<br/>
Wild work in Heav’n, and dangerous to the maine.<br/>
Two dayes are therefore past, the third is thine;<br/>
For thee I have ordain’d it, and thus farr<br/>
Have sufferd, that the Glorie may be thine<br/>
Of ending this great Warr, since none but Thou<br/>
Can end it.  Into thee such Vertue and Grace<br/>
Immense I have transfus’d, that all may know<br/>
In Heav’n and Hell thy Power above compare,<br/>
And this perverse Commotion governd thus,<br/>
To manifest thee worthiest to be Heir<br/>
Of all things, to be Heir and to be King<br/>
By Sacred Unction, thy deserved right.<br/>
Go then thou Mightiest in thy Fathers might,<br/>
Ascend my Chariot, guide the rapid Wheeles<br/>
That shake Heav’ns basis, bring forth all my Warr,<br/>
My Bow and Thunder, my Almightie Arms<br/>
Gird on, and Sword upon thy puissant Thigh;<br/>
Pursue these sons of Darkness, drive them out<br/>
From all Heav’ns bounds into the utter Deep:<br/>
There let them learn, as likes them, to despise<br/>
God and <i>Messiah</i> his anointed King.<br/>
</p>
<p class="poem">
He said, and on his Son with Rayes direct<br/>
Shon full, he all his Father full exprest<br/>
Ineffably into his face receiv’d,<br/>
And thus the filial Godhead answering spake.<br/>
</p>
<p class="poem">
O Father, O Supream of heav’nly Thrones,<br/>
First, Highest, Holiest, Best, thou alwayes seekst<br/>
To glorifie thy Son, I alwayes thee,<br/>
As is most just; this I my Glorie account,<br/>
My exaltation, and my whole delight,<br/>
That thou in me well pleas’d, declarst thy will<br/>
Fulfill’d, which to fulfil is all my bliss.<br/>
Scepter and Power, thy giving, I assume,<br/>
And gladlier shall resign, when in the end<br/>
Thou shalt be All in All, and I in thee<br/>
For ever, and in mee all whom thou lov’st:<br/>
But whom thou hat’st, I hate, and can put on<br/>
Thy terrors, as I put thy mildness on,<br/>
Image of thee in all things; and shall soon,<br/>
Armd with thy might, rid heav’n of these rebell’d,<br/>
To thir prepar’d ill Mansion driven down<br/>
To chains of Darkness, and th’ undying Worm,<br/>
That from thy just obedience could revolt,<br/>
Whom to obey is happiness entire.<br/>
Then shall thy Saints unmixt, and from th’ impure<br/>
Farr separate, circling thy holy Mount<br/>
Unfained <i>Halleluiahs</i> to thee sing,<br/>
Hymns of high praise, and I among them chief.<br/>
So said, he o’re his Scepter bowing, rose<br/>
From the right hand of Glorie where he sate,<br/>
And the third sacred Morn began to shine<br/>
Dawning through Heav’n: forth rush’d with whirlwind sound<br/>
The Chariot of Paternal Deitie,<br/>
Flashing thick flames, Wheele within Wheele undrawn,<br/>
It self instinct with Spirit, but convoyd<br/>
By four Cherubic shapes, four Faces each<br/>
Had wondrous, as with Starrs thir bodies all<br/>
And Wings were set with Eyes, with Eyes the Wheels<br/>
Of Beril, and careering Fires between;<br/>
Over thir heads a chrystal Firmament,<br/>
Whereon a Saphir Throne, inlaid with pure<br/>
Amber, and colours of the showrie Arch.<br/>
Hee in Celestial Panoplie all armd<br/>
Of radiant <i>Urim</i>, work divinely wrought,<br/>
Ascended, at his right hand Victorie<br/>
Sate Eagle-wing’d, beside him hung his Bow<br/>
And Quiver with three-bolted Thunder stor’d,<br/>
And from about him fierce Effusion rowld<br/>
Of smoak and bickering flame, and sparkles dire;<br/>
Attended with ten thousand thousand Saints,<br/>
He onward came, farr off his coming shon,<br/>
And twentie thousand (I thir number heard)<br/>
Chariots of God, half on each hand were seen:<br/>
Hee on the wings of Cherub rode sublime<br/>
On the Crystallin Skie, in Saphir Thron’d.<br/>
Illustrious farr and wide, but by his own<br/>
First seen, them unexpected joy surpriz’d,<br/>
When the great Ensign of <i>Messiah</i> blaz’d<br/>
Aloft by Angels born, his Sign in Heav’n:<br/>
Under whose Conduct <i>Michael</i> soon reduc’d<br/>
His Armie, circumfus’d on either Wing,<br/>
Under thir Head imbodied all in one.<br/>
Before him Power Divine his way prepar’d;<br/>
At his command the uprooted Hills retir’d<br/>
Each to his place, they heard his voice and went<br/>
Obsequious, Heav’n his wonted face renewd,<br/>
And with fresh Flourets Hill and Valley smil’d.<br/>
This saw his hapless Foes, but stood obdur’d,<br/>
And to rebellious fight rallied thir Powers<br/>
Insensate, hope conceiving from despair.<br/>
In heav’nly Spirits could such perverseness dwell?<br/>
But to convince the proud what Signs availe,<br/>
Or Wonders move th’ obdurate to relent?<br/>
They hard’nd more by what might most reclame,<br/>
Grieving to see his Glorie, at the sight<br/>
Took envie, and aspiring to his highth,<br/>
Stood reimbattell’d fierce, by force or fraud<br/>
Weening to prosper, and at length prevaile<br/>
Against God and <i>Messiah</i>, or to fall<br/>
In universal ruin last, and now<br/>
To final Battel drew, disdaining flight,<br/>
Or faint retreat; when the great Son of God<br/>
To all his Host on either hand thus spake.<br/>
</p>
<p class="poem">
Stand still in bright array ye Saints, here stand<br/>
Ye Angels arm’d, this day from Battel rest;<br/>
Faithful hath been your Warfare, and of God<br/>
Accepted, fearless in his righteous Cause,<br/>
And as ye have receivd, so have ye don<br/>
Invincibly; but of this cursed crew<br/>
The punishment to other hand belongs,<br/>
Vengeance is his, or whose he sole appoints;<br/>
Number to this dayes work is not ordain’d<br/>
Nor multitude, stand onely and behold<br/>
Gods indignation on these Godless pourd<br/>
By mee; not you but mee they have despis’d,<br/>
Yet envied; against mee is all thir rage,<br/>
Because the Father, t’ whom in Heav’n supream<br/>
Kingdom and Power and Glorie appertains,<br/>
Hath honourd me according to his will.<br/>
Therefore to mee thir doom he hath assig’n’d;<br/>
That they may have thir wish, to trie with mee<br/>
In Battel which the stronger proves, they all,<br/>
Or I alone against them, since by strength<br/>
They measure all, of other excellence<br/>
Not emulous, nor care who them excells;<br/>
Nor other strife with them do I voutsafe.<br/>
</p>
<p class="poem">
So spake the Son, and into terrour chang’d<br/>
His count’nance too severe to be beheld<br/>
And full of wrauth bent on his Enemies.<br/>
At once the Four spred out thir Starrie wings<br/>
With dreadful shade contiguous, and the Orbes<br/>
Of his fierce Chariot rowld, as with the sound<br/>
Of torrent Floods, or of a numerous Host.<br/>
Hee on his impious Foes right onward drove,<br/>
Gloomie as Night; under his burning Wheeles<br/>
The stedfast Empyrean shook throughout,<br/>
All but the Throne it self of God.  Full soon<br/>
Among them he arriv’d; in his right hand<br/>
Grasping ten thousand Thunders, which he sent<br/>
Before him, such as in thir Soules infix’d<br/>
Plagues; they astonisht all resistance lost,<br/>
All courage; down thir idle weapons drop’d;<br/>
O’re Shields and Helmes, and helmed heads he rode<br/>
Of Thrones and mighty Seraphim prostrate,<br/>
That wish’d the Mountains now might be again<br/>
Thrown on them as a shelter from his ire.<br/>
Nor less on either side tempestuous fell<br/>
His arrows, from the fourfold-visag’d Foure,<br/>
Distinct with eyes, and from the living Wheels,<br/>
Distinct alike with multitude of eyes,<br/>
One Spirit in them rul’d, and every eye<br/>
Glar’d lightning, and shot forth pernicious fire<br/>
Among th’ accurst, that witherd all thir strength,<br/>
And of thir wonted vigour left them draind,<br/>
Exhausted, spiritless, afflicted, fall’n.<br/>
Yet half his strength he put not forth, but check’d<br/>
His Thunder in mid Volie, for he meant<br/>
Not to destroy, but root them out of Heav’n:<br/>
The overthrown he rais’d, and as a Heard<br/>
Of Goats or timerous flock together throngd<br/>
Drove them before him Thunder-struck, pursu’d<br/>
With terrors and with furies to the bounds<br/>
And Chrystall wall of Heav’n, which op’ning wide,<br/>
Rowld inward, and a spacious Gap disclos’d<br/>
Into the wastful Deep; the monstrous sight<br/>
Strook them with horror backward, but far worse<br/>
Urg’d them behind; headlong themselvs they threw<br/>
Down from the verge of Heav’n, Eternal wrauth<br/>
Burnt after them to the bottomless pit.<br/>
</p>
<p class="poem">
Hell heard th’ unsufferable noise, Hell saw<br/>
Heav’n ruining from Heav’n and would have fled<br/>
Affrighted; but strict Fate had cast too deep<br/>
Her dark foundations, and too fast had bound.<br/>
Nine dayes they fell; confounded <i>Chaos</i> roard,<br/>
And felt tenfold confusion in thir fall<br/>
Through his wilde Anarchie, so huge a rout<br/>
Incumberd him with ruin: Hell at last<br/>
Yawning receavd them whole, and on them clos’d,<br/>
Hell thir fit habitation fraught with fire<br/>
Unquenchable, the house of woe and paine.<br/>
Disburd’nd Heav’n rejoic’d, and soon repaird<br/>
Her mural breach, returning whence it rowld.<br/>
Sole Victor from th’ expulsion of his Foes<br/>
<i>Messiah</i> his triumphal Chariot turnd:<br/>
To meet him all his Saints, who silent stood<br/>
Eye witnesses of his Almightie Acts,<br/>
With Jubilie advanc’d; and as they went,<br/>
Shaded with branching Palme, each order bright,<br/>
Sung Triumph, and him sung Victorious King,<br/>
Son, Heire, and Lord, to him Dominion giv’n,<br/>
Worthiest to Reign: he celebrated rode<br/>
Triumphant through mid Heav’n, into the Courts<br/>
And Temple of his mightie Father Thron’d<br/>
On high; who into Glorie him receav’d,<br/>
Where now he sits at the right hand of bliss.<br/>
</p>
<p class="poem">
Thus measuring things in Heav’n by things on Earth<br/>
At thy request, and that thou maist beware<br/>
By what is past, to thee I have reveal’d<br/>
What might have else to human Race bin hid;<br/>
The discord which befel, and Warr in Heav’n<br/>
Among th’ Angelic Powers, and the deep fall<br/>
Of those too high aspiring, who rebelld<br/>
With <i>Satan</i>, hee who envies now thy state,<br/>
Who now is plotting how he may seduce<br/>
Thee also from obedience, that with him<br/>
Bereavd of happiness thou maist partake<br/>
His punishment, Eternal miserie;<br/>
Which would be all his solace and revenge,<br/>
As a despite don against the most High,<br/>
Thee once to gaine Companion of his woe.<br/>
But list’n not to his Temptations, warne<br/>
Thy weaker; let it profit thee to have heard<br/>
By terrible Example the reward<br/>
Of disobedience; firm they might have stood,<br/>
Yet fell; remember, and fear to transgress.<br/>
