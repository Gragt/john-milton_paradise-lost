				<h3 epub:type="title">The Argument</h3>
				<p>The Angel Michael continues, from the Flood, to relate what shall
succeed; then, in the mention of Abraham, comes by degrees to explain
who that Seed of the Woman shall be which was promised Adam and
Eve in the Fall; his incarnation, death, resurrection, and ascension;
the state of the Church till his second coming. Adam, greatly satisfied
and recomforted by these relations and promises, descends the hill with
Michael; wakens Eve, who all this while had slept, but with gentle
dreams composed to quietness of mind and submission. Michael in
either hand leads them out of Paradise, the fiery sword waving behind
them, and the Cherubim taking their stations to guard the place.</p>
