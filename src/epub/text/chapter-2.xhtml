<p class="pfirst">
High on a Throne of Royal State, which far<br/>
Outshon the wealth of <i>Ormus</i> and of <i>Ind</i>,<br/>
Or where the gorgeous East with richest hand<br/>
Showrs on her Kings <i>Barbaric</i> Pearl &amp; Gold,<br/>
Satan exalted sat, by merit rais’d<br/>
To that bad eminence; and from despair<br/>
Thus high uplifted beyond hope, aspires<br/>
Beyond thus high, insatiate to pursue<br/>
Vain Warr with Heav’n, and by success untaught<br/>
His proud imaginations thus displaid.<br/>
</p>
<p class="poem">
Powers and Dominions, Deities of Heav’n,<br/>
For since no deep within her gulf can hold<br/>
Immortal vigor, though opprest and fall’n,<br/>
I give not Heav’n for lost.  From this descent<br/>
Celestial vertues rising, will appear<br/>
More glorious and more dread then from no fall,<br/>
And trust themselves to fear no second fate:<br/>
Mee though just right, and the fixt Laws of Heav’n<br/>
Did first create your Leader, next, free choice,<br/>
With what besides, in Counsel or in Fight,<br/>
Hath bin achievd of merit, yet this loss<br/>
Thus farr at least recover’d, hath much more<br/>
Establisht in a safe unenvied Throne<br/>
Yeilded with full consent.  The happier state<br/>
In Heav’n, which follows dignity, might draw<br/>
Envy from each inferior; but who here<br/>
Will envy whom the highest place exposes<br/>
Formost to stand against the Thunderers aime<br/>
Your bulwark, and condemns to greatest share<br/>
Of endless pain? where there is then no good<br/>
For which to strive, no strife can grow up there<br/>
From Faction; for none sure will claim in hell<br/>
Precedence, none, whose portion is so small<br/>
Of present pain, that with ambitious mind<br/>
Will covet more.  With this advantage then<br/>
To union, and firm Faith, and firm accord,<br/>
More then can be in Heav’n, we now return<br/>
To claim our just inheritance of old,<br/>
Surer to prosper then prosperity<br/>
Could have assur’d us; and by what best way,<br/>
Whether of open Warr or covert guile,<br/>
We now debate; who can advise, may speak.<br/>
</p>
<p class="poem">
He ceas’d, and next him <i>Moloc</i>, Scepter’d King<br/>
Stood up, the strongest and the fiercest Spirit<br/>
That fought in Heav’n; now fiercer by despair:<br/>
His trust was with th’ Eternal to be deem’d<br/>
Equal in strength, and rather then be less<br/>
Car’d not to be at all; with that care lost<br/>
Went all his fear: of God, or Hell, or worse<br/>
He reckd not, and these words thereafter spake.<br/>
</p>
<p class="poem">
My sentence is for open Warr: Of Wiles,<br/>
More unexpert, I boast not: them let those<br/>
Contrive who need, or when they need, not now.<br/>
For while they sit contriving, shall the rest,<br/>
Millions that stand in Arms, and longing wait<br/>
The Signal to ascend, sit lingring here<br/>
Heav’ns fugitives, and for thir dwelling place<br/>
Accept this dark opprobrious Den of shame,<br/>
The Prison of his Tyranny who Reigns<br/>
By our delay? no, let us rather choose<br/>
Arm’d with Hell flames and fury all at once<br/>
O’re Heav’ns high Towrs to force resistless way,<br/>
Turning our Tortures into horrid Arms<br/>
Against the Torturer; when to meet the noise<br/>
Of his Almighty Engin he shall hear<br/>
Infernal Thunder, and for Lightning see<br/>
Black fire and horror shot with equal rage<br/>
Among his Angels; and his Throne it self<br/>
Mixt with <i>Tartarean</i> Sulphur, and strange fire,<br/>
His own invented Torments.  But perhaps<br/>
The way seems difficult and steep to scale<br/>
With upright wing against a higher foe.<br/>
Let such bethink them, if the sleepy drench<br/>
Of that forgetful Lake benumme not still,<br/>
That in our proper motion we ascend<br/>
Up to our native seat: descent and fall<br/>
To us is adverse.  Who but felt of late<br/>
When the fierce Foe hung on our brok’n Rear<br/>
Insulting, and pursu’d us through the Deep,<br/>
With what compulsion and laborious flight<br/>
We sunk thus low?  Th’ ascent is easie then;<br/>
Th’ event is fear’d; should we again provoke<br/>
Our stronger, some worse way his wrath may find<br/>
To our destruction: if there be in Hell<br/>
Fear to be worse destroy’d: what can be worse<br/>
Then to dwell here, driv’n out from bliss, condemn’d<br/>
In this abhorred deep to utter woe;<br/>
Where pain of unextinguishable fire<br/>
Must exercise us without hope of end<br/>
The Vassals of his anger, when the Scourge<br/>
Inexorably, and the torturing houre<br/>
Calls us to Penance?  More destroy’d then thus<br/>
We should be quite abolisht and expire.<br/>
What fear we then? what doubt we to incense<br/>
His utmost ire? which to the highth enrag’d,<br/>
Will either quite consume us, and reduce<br/>
To nothing this essential, happier farr<br/>
Then miserable to have eternal being:<br/>
Or if our substance be indeed Divine,<br/>
And cannot cease to be, we are at worst<br/>
On this side nothing; and by proof we feel<br/>
Our power sufficient to disturb his Heav’n,<br/>
And with perpetual inrodes to Allarme,<br/>
Though inaccessible, his fatal Throne:<br/>
Which if not Victory is yet Revenge.<br/>
</p>
<p class="poem">
He ended frowning, and his look denounc’d<br/>
Desperate revenge, and Battel dangerous<br/>
To less then Gods.  On th’ other side up rose<br/>
<i>Belial</i>, in act more graceful and humane;<br/>
A fairer person lost not Heav’n; he seemd<br/>
For dignity compos’d and high exploit:<br/>
But all was false and hollow; though his Tongue<br/>
Dropt Manna, and could make the worse appear<br/>
The better reason, to perplex and dash<br/>
Maturest Counsels: for his thoughts were low;<br/>
To vice industrious, but to Nobler deeds<br/>
Timorous and slothful: yet he pleas’d the eare,<br/>
And with perswasive accent thus began.<br/>
</p>
<p class="poem">
I should be much for open Warr, O Peers,<br/>
As not behind in hate; if what was urg’d<br/>
Main reason to perswade immediate Warr,<br/>
Did not disswade me most, and seem to cast<br/>
Ominous conjecture on the whole success:<br/>
When he who most excels in fact of Arms,<br/>
In what he counsels and in what excels<br/>
Mistrustful, grounds his courage on despair<br/>
And utter dissolution, as the scope<br/>
Of all his aim, after some dire revenge.<br/>
First, what Revenge? the Towrs of Heav’n are fill’d<br/>
With Armed watch, that render all access<br/>
Impregnable; oft on the bordering Deep<br/>
Encamp thir Legions, or with obscure wing<br/>
Scout farr and wide into the Realm of night,<br/>
Scorning surprize.  Or could we break our way<br/>
By force, and at our heels all Hell should rise<br/>
With blackest Insurrection, to confound<br/>
Heav’ns purest Light, yet our great Enemie<br/>
All incorruptible would on his Throne<br/>
Sit unpolluted, and th’ Ethereal mould<br/>
Incapable of stain would soon expel<br/>
Her mischief, and purge off the baser fire<br/>
Victorious.  Thus repuls’d, our final hope<br/>
Is flat despair: we must exasperate<br/>
Th’ Almighty Victor to spend all his rage,<br/>
And that must end us, that must be our cure,<br/>
To be no more; sad cure; for who would loose,<br/>
Though full of pain, this intellectual being,<br/>
Those thoughts that wander through Eternity,<br/>
To perish rather, swallowd up and lost<br/>
In the wide womb of uncreated night,<br/>
Devoid of sense and motion? and who knows,<br/>
Let this be good, whether our angry Foe<br/>
Can give it, or will ever? how he can<br/>
Is doubtful; that he never will is sure.<br/>
Will he, so wise, let loose at once his ire,<br/>
Belike through impotence, or unaware,<br/>
To give his Enemies thir wish, and end<br/>
Them in his anger, whom his anger saves<br/>
To punish endless? wherefore cease we then?<br/>
Say they who counsel Warr, we are decreed,<br/>
Reserv’d and destin’d to Eternal woe;<br/>
Whatever doing, what can we suffer more,<br/>
What can we suffer worse? is this then worst,<br/>
Thus sitting, thus consulting, thus in Arms?<br/>
What when we fled amain, pursu’d and strook<br/>
With Heav’ns afflicting Thunder, and besought<br/>
The Deep to shelter us? this Hell then seem’d<br/>
A refuge from those wounds: or when we lay<br/>
Chain’d on the burning Lake? that sure was worse.<br/>
What if the breath that kindl’d those grim fires<br/>
Awak’d should blow them into sevenfold rage<br/>
And plunge us in the Flames? or from above<br/>
Should intermitted vengeance Arme again<br/>
His red right hand to plague us? what if all<br/>
Her stores were op’n’d, and this Firmament<br/>
Of Hell should spout her Cataracts of Fire,<br/>
Impendent horrors, threatning hideous fall<br/>
One day upon our heads; while we perhaps<br/>
Designing or exhorting glorious Warr,<br/>
Caught in a fierie Tempest shall be hurl’d<br/>
Each on his rock transfixt, the sport and prey<br/>
Of racking whirlwinds, or for ever sunk<br/>
Under yon boyling Ocean, wrapt in Chains;<br/>
There to converse with everlasting groans,<br/>
Unrespited, unpitied, unrepreevd,<br/>
Ages of hopeless end; this would be worse.<br/>
Warr therefore, open or conceal’d, alike<br/>
My voice disswades; for what can force or guile<br/>
With him, or who deceive his mind, whose eye<br/>
Views all things at one view? he from heav’ns highth<br/>
All these our motions vain, sees and derides;<br/>
Not more Almighty to resist our might<br/>
Then wise to frustrate all our plots and wiles.<br/>
Shall we then live thus vile, the race of Heav’n<br/>
Thus trampl’d, thus expell’d to suffer here<br/>
Chains &amp; these Torments? better these then worse<br/>
By my advice; since fate inevitable<br/>
Subdues us, and Omnipotent Decree,<br/>
The Victors will.  To suffer, as to doe,<br/>
Our strength is equal, nor the Law unjust<br/>
That so ordains: this was at first resolv’d,<br/>
If we were wise, against so great a foe<br/>
Contending, and so doubtful what might fall.<br/>
I laugh, when those who at the Spear are bold<br/>
And vent’rous, if that fail them, shrink and fear<br/>
What yet they know must follow, to endure<br/>
Exile, or ignominy, or bonds, or pain,<br/>
The sentence of thir Conquerour: This is now<br/>
Our doom; which if we can sustain and bear,<br/>
Our Supream Foe in time may much remit<br/>
His anger, and perhaps thus farr remov’d<br/>
Not mind us not offending, satisfi’d<br/>
With what is punish’t; whence these raging fires<br/>
Will slack’n, if his breath stir not thir flames.<br/>
Our purer essence then will overcome<br/>
Thir noxious vapour, or enur’d not feel,<br/>
Or chang’d at length, and to the place conformd<br/>
In temper and in nature, will receive<br/>
Familiar the fierce heat, and void of pain;<br/>
This horror will grow milde, this darkness light,<br/>
Besides what hope the never-ending flight<br/>
Of future days may bring, what chance, what change<br/>
Worth waiting, since our present lot appeers<br/>
For happy though but ill, for ill not worst,<br/>
If we procure not to our selves more woe.<br/>
</p>
<p class="poem">
Thus <i>Belial</i> with words cloath’d in reasons garb<br/>
Counsel’d ignoble ease, and peaceful sloath,<br/>
Not peace: and after him thus <i>Mammon</i> spake.<br/>
</p>
<p class="poem">
Either to disinthrone the King of Heav’n<br/>
We warr, if warr be best, or to regain<br/>
Our own right lost: him to unthrone we then<br/>
May hope, when everlasting Fate shall yeild<br/>
To fickle Chance, and <i>Chaos</i> judge the strife:<br/>
The former vain to hope argues as vain<br/>
The latter: for what place can be for us<br/>
Within Heav’ns bound, unless Heav’ns Lord supream<br/>
We overpower?  Suppose he should relent<br/>
And publish Grace to all, on promise made<br/>
Of new Subjection; with what eyes could we<br/>
Stand in his presence humble, and receive<br/>
Strict Laws impos’d, to celebrate his Throne<br/>
With warbl’d Hymns, and to his Godhead sing<br/>
Forc’t Halleluiah’s; while he Lordly sits<br/>
Our envied Sovran, and his Altar breathes<br/>
Ambrosial Odours and Ambrosial Flowers,<br/>
Our servile offerings.  This must be our task<br/>
In Heav’n, this our delight; how wearisom<br/>
Eternity so spent in worship paid<br/>
To whom we hate.  Let us not then pursue<br/>
By force impossible, by leave obtain’d<br/>
Unacceptable, though in Heav’n, our state<br/>
Of splendid vassalage, but rather seek<br/>
Our own good from our selves, and from our own<br/>
Live to our selves, though in this vast recess,<br/>
Free, and to none accountable, preferring<br/>
Hard liberty before the easie yoke<br/>
Of servile Pomp.  Our greatness will appear<br/>
Then most conspicuous, when great things of small,<br/>
Useful of hurtful, prosperous of adverse<br/>
We can create, and in what place so e’re<br/>
Thrive under evil, and work ease out of pain<br/>
Through labour and endurance.  This deep world<br/>
Of darkness do we dread?  How oft amidst<br/>
Thick clouds and dark doth Heav’ns all-ruling Sire<br/>
Choose to reside, his Glory unobscur’d,<br/>
And with the Majesty of darkness round<br/>
Covers his Throne; from whence deep thunders roar<br/>
Must’ring thir rage, and Heav’n resembles Hell?<br/>
As he our Darkness, cannot we his Light<br/>
Imitate when we please?  This Desart soile<br/>
Wants not her hidden lustre, Gemms and Gold;<br/>
Nor want we skill or art, from whence to raise<br/>
Magnificence; and what can Heav’n shew more?<br/>
Our torments also may in length of time<br/>
Become our Elements, these piercing Fires<br/>
As soft as now severe, our temper chang’d<br/>
Into their temper; which must needs remove<br/>
The sensible of pain.  All things invite<br/>
To peaceful Counsels, and the settl’d State<br/>
Of order, how in safety best we may<br/>
Compose our present evils, with regard<br/>
Of what we are and where, dismissing quite<br/>
All thoughts of Warr: ye have what I advise.<br/>
</p>
<p class="poem">
He scarce had finisht, when such murmur filld<br/>
Th’ Assembly, as when hollow Rocks retain<br/>
The sound of blustring winds, which all night long<br/>
Had rous’d the Sea, now with hoarse cadence lull<br/>
Sea-faring men orewatcht, whose Bark by chance<br/>
Or Pinnace anchors in a craggy Bay<br/>
After the Tempest: Such applause was heard<br/>
As <i>Mammon</i> ended, and his Sentence pleas’d,<br/>
Advising peace: for such another Field<br/>
They dreaded worse then Hell: so much the fear<br/>
Of Thunder and the Sword of <i>Michael</i><br/>
Wrought still within them; and no less desire<br/>
To found this nether Empire, which might rise<br/>
By pollicy, and long process of time,<br/>
In emulation opposite to Heav’n.<br/>
Which when <i>Beelzebub</i> perceiv’d, then whom,<br/>
<i>Satan</i> except, none higher sat, with grave<br/>
Aspect he rose, and in his rising seem’d<br/>
A Pillar of State; deep on his Front engraven<br/>
Deliberation sat and publick care;<br/>
And Princely counsel in his face yet shon,<br/>
Majestick though in ruin: sage he stood<br/>
With <i>Atlantean</i> shoulders fit to bear<br/>
The weight of mightiest Monarchies; his look<br/>
Drew audience and attention still as Night<br/>
Or Summers Noon-tide air, while thus he spake.<br/>
</p>
<p class="poem">
Thrones and imperial Powers, off-spring of heav’n,<br/>
Ethereal Vertues; or these Titles now<br/>
Must we renounce, and changing stile be call’d<br/>
Princes of Hell? for so the popular vote<br/>
Inclines, here to continue, and build up here<br/>
A growing Empire; doubtless; while we dream,<br/>
And know not that the King of Heav’n hath doom’d<br/>
This place our dungeon, not our safe retreat<br/>
Beyond his Potent arm, to live exempt<br/>
From Heav’ns high jurisdiction, in new League<br/>
Banded against his Throne, but to remaine<br/>
In strictest bondage, though thus far remov’d,<br/>
Under th’ inevitable curb, reserv’d<br/>
His captive multitude: For he, be sure,<br/>
In highth or depth, still first and last will Reign<br/>
Sole King, and of his Kingdom loose no part<br/>
By our revolt, but over Hell extend<br/>
His Empire, and with Iron Scepter rule<br/>
Us here, as with his Golden those in Heav’n.<br/>
What sit we then projecting Peace and Warr?<br/>
Warr hath determin’d us, and foild with loss<br/>
Irreparable; tearms of peace yet none<br/>
Voutsaf’t or sought; for what peace will be giv’n<br/>
To us enslav’d, but custody severe,<br/>
And stripes, and arbitrary punishment<br/>
Inflicted? and what peace can we return,<br/>
But to our power hostility and hate,<br/>
Untam’d reluctance, and revenge though slow,<br/>
Yet ever plotting how the Conquerour least<br/>
May reap his conquest, and may least rejoyce<br/>
In doing what we most in suffering feel?<br/>
Nor will occasion want, nor shall we need<br/>
With dangerous expedition to invade<br/>
Heav’n, whose high walls fear no assault or Siege,<br/>
Or ambush from the Deep.  What if we find<br/>
Some easier enterprize?  There is a place<br/>
(If ancient and prophetic fame in Heav’n<br/>
Err not) another World, the happy seat<br/>
Of som new Race call’d <i>Man</i>, about this time<br/>
To be created like to us, though less<br/>
In power and excellence, but favour’d more<br/>
Of him who rules above; so was his will<br/>
Pronounc’d among the Gods, and by an Oath,<br/>
That shook Heav’ns whol circumference, confirm’d.<br/>
Thither let us bend all our thoughts, to learn<br/>
What creatures there inhabit, of what mould,<br/>
Or substance, how endu’d, and what thir Power,<br/>
And where thir weakness, how attempted best,<br/>
By force or suttlety: Though Heav’n be shut,<br/>
And Heav’ns high Arbitrator sit secure<br/>
In his own strength, this place may lye expos’d<br/>
The utmost border of his Kingdom, left<br/>
To their defence who hold it: here perhaps<br/>
Som advantagious act may be achiev’d<br/>
By sudden onset, either with Hell fire<br/>
To waste his whole Creation, or possess<br/>
All as our own, and drive as we were driven,<br/>
The punie habitants, or if not drive,<br/>
Seduce them to our Party, that thir God<br/>
May prove thir foe, and with repenting hand<br/>
Abolish his own works.  This would surpass<br/>
Common revenge, and interrupt his joy<br/>
In our Confusion, and our Joy upraise<br/>
In his disturbance; when his darling Sons<br/>
Hurl’d headlong to partake with us, shall curse<br/>
Thir frail Originals, and faded bliss,<br/>
Faded so soon.  Advise if this be worth<br/>
Attempting, or to sit in darkness here<br/>
Hatching vain Empires.  Thus <i>Beelzebub</i><br/>
Pleaded his devilish Counsel, first devis’d<br/>
By <i>Satan</i>, and in part propos’d: for whence,<br/>
But from the Author of all ill could Spring<br/>
So deep a malice, to confound the race<br/>
Of mankind in one root, and Earth with Hell<br/>
To mingle and involve, done all to spite<br/>
The great Creatour?  But thir spite still serves<br/>
His glory to augment.  The bold design<br/>
Pleas’d highly those infernal States, and joy<br/>
Sparkl’d in all thir eyes; with full assent<br/>
They vote: whereat his speech he thus renews.<br/>
</p>
<p class="poem">
Well have ye judg’d, well ended long debate,<br/>
Synod of Gods, and like to what ye are,<br/>
Great things resolv’d; which from the lowest deep<br/>
Will once more lift us up, in spight of Fate,<br/>
Neerer our ancient Seat; perhaps in view<br/>
Of those bright confines, whence with neighbouring Arms<br/>
And opportune excursion we may chance<br/>
Re-enter Heav’n; or else in some milde Zone<br/>
Dwell not unvisited of Heav’ns fair Light<br/>
Secure, and at the brightning Orient beam<br/>
Purge off this gloom; the soft delicious Air,<br/>
To heal the scarr of these corrosive Fires<br/>
Shall breath her balme.  But first whom shall we send<br/>
In search of this new world, whom shall we find<br/>
Sufficient? who shall tempt with wandring feet<br/>
The dark unbottom’d infinite Abyss<br/>
And through the palpable obscure find out<br/>
His uncouth way, or spread his aerie flight<br/>
Upborn with indefatigable wings<br/>
Over the vast abrupt, ere he arrive<br/>
The happy Ile; what strength, what art can then<br/>
Suffice, or what evasion bear him safe<br/>
Through the strict Senteries and Stations thick<br/>
Of Angels watching round?  Here he had need<br/>
All circumspection, and we now no less<br/>
Choice in our suffrage; for on whom we send,<br/>
The weight of all and our last hope relies.<br/>
</p>
<p class="poem">
This said, he sat; and expectation held<br/>
His look suspence, awaiting who appeer’d<br/>
To second, or oppose, or undertake<br/>
The perilous attempt: but all sat mute,<br/>
Pondering the danger with deep thoughts; &amp; each<br/>
In others count’nance red his own dismay<br/>
Astonisht: none among the choice and prime<br/>
Of those Heav’n-warring Champions could be found<br/>
So hardie as to proffer or accept<br/>
Alone the dreadful voyage; till at last<br/>
<i>Satan</i>, whom now transcendent glory rais’d<br/>
Above his fellows, with Monarchal pride<br/>
Conscious of highest worth, unmov’d thus spake.<br/>
</p>
<p class="poem">
O Progeny of Heav’n, Empyreal Thrones,<br/>
With reason hath deep silence and demurr<br/>
Seis’d us, though undismaid: long is the way<br/>
And hard, that out of Hell leads up to Light;<br/>
Our prison strong, this huge convex of Fire,<br/>
Outrageous to devour, immures us round<br/>
Ninefold, and gates of burning Adamant<br/>
Barr’d over us prohibit all egress.<br/>
These past, if any pass, the void profound<br/>
Of unessential Night receives him next<br/>
Wide gaping, and with utter loss of being<br/>
Threatens him, plung’d in that abortive gulf.<br/>
If thence he scape into what ever world,<br/>
Or unknown Region, what remains him less<br/>
Then unknown dangers and as hard escape.<br/>
But I should ill become this Throne, O Peers,<br/>
And this Imperial Sov’ranty, adorn’d<br/>
With splendor, arm’d with power, if aught propos’d<br/>
And judg’d of public moment, in the shape<br/>
Of difficulty or danger could deterre<br/>
Me from attempting.  Wherefore do I assume<br/>
These Royalties, and not refuse to Reign,<br/>
Refusing to accept as great a share<br/>
Of hazard as of honour, due alike<br/>
To him who Reigns, and so much to him due<br/>
Of hazard more, as he above the rest<br/>
High honourd sits?  Go therfore mighty powers,<br/>
Terror of Heav’n, though fall’n; intend at home,<br/>
While here shall be our home, what best may ease<br/>
The present misery, and render Hell<br/>
More tollerable; if there be cure or charm<br/>
To respite or deceive, or slack the pain<br/>
Of this ill Mansion: intermit no watch<br/>
Against a wakeful Foe, while I abroad<br/>
Through all the coasts of dark destruction seek<br/>
Deliverance for us all: this enterprize<br/>
None shall partake with me.  Thus saying rose<br/>
The Monarch, and prevented all reply,<br/>
Prudent, least from his resolution rais’d<br/>
Others among the chief might offer now<br/>
(Certain to be refus’d) what erst they feard;<br/>
And so refus’d might in opinion stand<br/>
His rivals, winning cheap the high repute<br/>
Which he through hazard huge must earn.  But they<br/>
Dreaded not more th’ adventure then his voice<br/>
Forbidding; and at once with him they rose;<br/>
Thir rising all at once was as the sound<br/>
Of Thunder heard remote.  Towards him they bend<br/>
With awful reverence prone; and as a God<br/>
Extoll him equal to the highest in Heav’n:<br/>
Nor fail’d they to express how much they prais’d,<br/>
That for the general safety he despis’d<br/>
His own: for neither do the Spirits damn’d<br/>
Loose all thir vertue; least bad men should boast<br/>
Thir specious deeds on earth, which glory excites,<br/>
Or close ambition varnisht o’re with zeal.<br/>
Thus they thir doubtful consultations dark<br/>
Ended rejoycing in thir matchless Chief:<br/>
As when from mountain tops the dusky clouds<br/>
Ascending, while the North wind sleeps, o’respread<br/>
Heav’ns chearful face, the lowring Element<br/>
Scowls ore the dark’nd lantskip Snow, or showre;<br/>
If chance the radiant Sun with farewell sweet<br/>
Extend his ev’ning beam, the fields revive,<br/>
The birds thir notes renew, and bleating herds<br/>
Attest thir joy, that hill and valley rings.<br/>
O shame to men!  Devil with Devil damn’d<br/>
Firm concord holds, men onely disagree<br/>
Of Creatures rational, though under hope<br/>
Of heavenly Grace: and God proclaiming peace,<br/>
Yet live in hatred, enmitie, and strife<br/>
Among themselves, and levie cruel warres,<br/>
Wasting the Earth, each other to destroy:<br/>
As if (which might induce us to accord)<br/>
Man had not hellish foes anow besides,<br/>
That day and night for his destruction waite.<br/>
</p>
<p class="poem">
The <i>Stygian</i> Councel thus dissolv’d; and forth<br/>
In order came the grand infernal Peers,<br/>
Midst came thir mighty Paramount, and seemd<br/>
Alone th’ Antagonist of Heav’n, nor less<br/>
Then Hells dread Emperour with pomp Supream,<br/>
And God-like imitated State; him round<br/>
A Globe of fierie Seraphim inclos’d<br/>
With bright imblazonrie, and horrent Arms.<br/>
Then of thir Session ended they bid cry<br/>
With Trumpets regal sound the great result:<br/>
Toward the four winds four speedy Cherubim<br/>
Put to thir mouths the sounding Alchymie<br/>
By Haralds voice explain’d: the hollow Abyss<br/>
Heard farr and wide, and all the host of Hell<br/>
With deafning shout, return’d them loud acclaim.<br/>
Thence more at ease thir minds and somwhat rais’d<br/>
By false presumptuous hope, the ranged powers<br/>
Disband, and wandring, each his several way<br/>
Pursues, as inclination or sad choice<br/>
Leads him perplext, where he may likeliest find<br/>
Truce to his restless thoughts, and entertain<br/>
The irksome hours, till his great Chief return.<br/>
Part on the Plain, or in the Air sublime<br/>
Upon the wing, or in swift race contend,<br/>
As at th’ Olympian Games or <i>Pythian</i> fields;<br/>
Part curb thir fierie Steeds, or shun the Goal<br/>
With rapid wheels, or fronted Brigads form.<br/>
As when to warn proud Cities warr appears<br/>
Wag’d in the troubl’d Skie, and Armies rush<br/>
To Battel in the Clouds, before each Van<br/>
Pric forth the Aerie Knights, and couch thir spears<br/>
Till thickest Legions close; with feats of Arms<br/>
From either end of Heav’n the welkin burns.<br/>
Others with vast <i>Typhoean</i> rage more fell<br/>
Rend up both Rocks and Hills, and ride the Air<br/>
In whirlwind; Hell scarce holds the wilde uproar.<br/>
As when <i>Alcides</i> from <i>Oealia</i> Crown’d<br/>
With conquest, felt th’ envenom’d robe, and tore<br/>
Through pain up by the roots <i>Thessalian</i> Pines,<br/>
And <i>Lichas</i> from the top of <i>Oeta</i> threw<br/>
Into th’ <i>Euboic</i> Sea.  Others more milde,<br/>
Retreated in a silent valley, sing<br/>
With notes Angelical to many a Harp<br/>
Thir own Heroic deeds and hapless fall<br/>
By doom of Battel; and complain that Fate<br/>
Free Vertue should enthrall to Force or Chance.<br/>
Thir song was partial, but the harmony<br/>
(What could it less when Spirits immortal sing?)<br/>
Suspended Hell, and took with ravishment<br/>
The thronging audience.  In discourse more sweet<br/>
(For Eloquence the Soul, Song charms the Sense,)<br/>
Others apart sat on a Hill retir’d,<br/>
In thoughts more elevate, and reason’d high<br/>
Of Providence, Foreknowledge, Will, and Fate,<br/>
Fixt Fate, free will, foreknowledge absolute,<br/>
And found no end, in wandring mazes lost.<br/>
Of good and evil much they argu’d then,<br/>
Of happiness and final misery,<br/>
Passion and Apathie, and glory and shame,<br/>
Vain wisdom all, and false Philosophie:<br/>
Yet with a pleasing sorcerie could charm<br/>
Pain for a while or anguish, and excite<br/>
Fallacious hope, or arm th’ obdured brest<br/>
With stubborn patience as with triple steel.<br/>
Another part in Squadrons and gross Bands,<br/>
On bold adventure to discover wide<br/>
That dismal world, if any Clime perhaps<br/>
Might yeild them easier habitation, bend<br/>
Four ways thir flying March, along the Banks<br/>
Of four infernal Rivers that disgorge<br/>
Into the burning Lake thir baleful streams;<br/>
Abhorred <i>Styx</i> the flood of deadly hate,<br/>
Sad <i>Acheron</i> of sorrow, black and deep;<br/>
<i>Cocytus</i>, nam’d of lamentation loud<br/>
Heard on the ruful stream; fierce <i>Phlegeton</i><br/>
Whose waves of torrent fire inflame with rage.<br/>
Farr off from these a slow and silent stream,<br/>
<i>Lethe</i> the River of Oblivion roules<br/>
Her watrie Labyrinth, whereof who drinks,<br/>
Forthwith his former state and being forgets,<br/>
Forgets both joy and grief, pleasure and pain.<br/>
Beyond this flood a frozen Continent<br/>
Lies dark and wilde, beat with perpetual storms<br/>
Of Whirlwind and dire Hail, which on firm land<br/>
Thaws not, but gathers heap, and ruin seems<br/>
Of ancient pile; all else deep snow and ice,<br/>
A gulf profound as that <i>Serbonian</i> Bog<br/>
Betwixt <i>Damiata</i> and mount <i>Casius</i> old,<br/>
Where Armies whole have sunk: the parching Air<br/>
Burns frore, and cold performs th’ effect of Fire.<br/>
Thither by harpy-footed Furies hail’d,<br/>
At certain revolutions all the damn’d<br/>
Are brought: and feel by turns the bitter change<br/>
Of fierce extreams, extreams by change more fierce,<br/>
From Beds of raging Fire to starve in Ice<br/>
Thir soft Ethereal warmth, and there to pine<br/>
Immovable, infixt, and frozen round,<br/>
Periods of time, thence hurried back to fire.<br/>
They ferry over this <i>Lethean</i> Sound<br/>
Both to and fro, thir sorrow to augment,<br/>
And wish and struggle, as they pass, to reach<br/>
The tempting stream, with one small drop to loose<br/>
In sweet forgetfulness all pain and woe,<br/>
All in one moment, and so neer the brink;<br/>
But fate withstands, and to oppose th’ attempt<br/>
<i>Medusa</i> with <i>Gorgonian</i> terror guards<br/>
The Ford, and of it self the water flies<br/>
All taste of living wight, as once it fled<br/>
The lip of <i>Tantalus</i>.  Thus roving on<br/>
In confus’d march forlorn, th’ adventrous Bands<br/>
With shuddring horror pale, and eyes agast<br/>
View’d first thir lamentable lot, and found<br/>
No rest: through many a dark and drearie Vaile<br/>
They pass’d, and many a Region dolorous,<br/>
O’re many a Frozen, many a Fierie Alpe,<br/>
Rocks, Caves, Lakes, Fens, Bogs, Dens, and shades of death,<br/>
A Universe of death, which God by curse<br/>
Created evil, for evil only good,<br/>
Where all life dies, death lives, and nature breeds,<br/>
Perverse, all monstrous, all prodigious things,<br/>
Abominable, inutterable, and worse<br/>
Then Fables yet have feign’d, or fear conceiv’d,<br/>
<i>Gorgons</i> and <i>Hydra’s</i>, and <i>Chimera’s</i> dire.<br/>
</p>
<p class="poem">
Mean while the Adversary of God and Man,<br/>
<i>Satan</i> with thoughts inflam’d of highest design,<br/>
Puts on swift wings, and toward the Gates of Hell<br/>
Explores his solitary flight; som times<br/>
He scours the right hand coast, som times the left,<br/>
Now shaves with level wing the Deep, then soares<br/>
Up to the fiery concave touring high.<br/>
As when farr off at Sea a Fleet descri’d<br/>
Hangs in the Clouds, by <i>Aequinoctial</i> Winds<br/>
Close sailing from <i>Bengala</i>, or the Iles<br/>
Of <i>Ternate</i> and <i>Tidore</i>, whence Merchants bring<br/>
Thir spicie Drugs: they on the trading Flood<br/>
Through the wide <i>Ethiopian</i> to the Cape<br/>
Ply stemming nightly toward the Pole.  So seem’d<br/>
Farr off the flying Fiend: at last appeer<br/>
Hell bounds high reaching to the horrid Roof,<br/>
And thrice threefold the Gates; three folds were Brass<br/>
Three Iron, three of Adamantine Rock,<br/>
Impenitrable, impal’d with circling fire,<br/>
Yet unconsum’d.  Before the Gates there sat<br/>
On either side a formidable shape;<br/>
The one seem’d Woman to the waste, and fair,<br/>
But ended foul in many a scaly fould<br/>
Voluminous and vast, a Serpent arm’d<br/>
With mortal sting: about her middle round<br/>
A cry of Hell Hounds never ceasing bark’d<br/>
With wide <i>Cerberean</i> mouths full loud, and rung<br/>
A hideous Peal: yet, when they list, would creep,<br/>
If aught disturb’d thir noyse, into her woomb,<br/>
And kennel there, yet there still bark’d and howl’d<br/>
Within unseen.  Farr less abhorrd then these<br/>
Vex’d <i>Scylla</i> bathing in the Sea that parts<br/>
<i>Calabria</i> from the hoarce <i>Trinacrian</i> shore:<br/>
Nor uglier follow the Night-Hag, when call’d<br/>
In secret, riding through the Air she comes<br/>
Lur’d with the smell of infant blood, to dance<br/>
With <i>Lapland</i> Witches, while the labouring Moon<br/>
Eclipses at thir charms.  The other shape,<br/>
If shape it might be call’d that shape had none<br/>
Distinguishable in member, joynt, or limb,<br/>
Or substance might be call’d that shadow seem’d,<br/>
For each seem’d either; black it stood as Night,<br/>
Fierce as ten Furies, terrible as Hell,<br/>
And shook a dreadful Dart; what seem’d his head<br/>
The likeness of a Kingly Crown had on.<br/>
<i>Satan</i> was now at hand, and from his seat<br/>
The Monster moving onward came as fast,<br/>
With horrid strides, Hell trembled as he strode.<br/>
Th’ undaunted Fiend what this might be admir’d,<br/>
Admir’d, not fear’d; God and his Son except,<br/>
Created thing naught vallu’d he nor shun’d;<br/>
And with disdainful look thus first began.<br/>
</p>
<p class="poem">
Whence and what art thou, execrable shape,<br/>
That dar’st, though grim and terrible, advance<br/>
Thy miscreated Front athwart my way<br/>
To yonder Gates? through them I mean to pass,<br/>
That be assur’d, without leave askt of thee:<br/>
Retire, or taste thy folly, and learn by proof,<br/>
Hell-born, not to contend with Spirits of Heav’n.<br/>
</p>
<p class="poem">
To whom the Goblin full of wrauth reply’d,<br/>

Who first broke peace in Heav’n and Faith, till then<br/>
Unbrok’n, and in proud rebellious Arms<br/>
Drew after him the third part of Heav’ns Sons<br/>
Conjur’d against the highest, for which both Thou<br/>
And they outcast from God, are here condemn’d<br/>
To waste Eternal daies in woe and pain?<br/>
And reck’n’st thou thy self with Spirits of Heav’n,<br/>
Hell-doomd, and breath’st defiance here and scorn,<br/>
Where I reign King, and to enrage thee more,<br/>
Thy King and Lord?  Back to thy punishment,<br/>
False fugitive, and to thy speed add wings,<br/>
Least with a whip of Scorpions I pursue<br/>
Thy lingring, or with one stroke of this Dart<br/>
Strange horror seise thee, and pangs unfelt before.<br/>

So spake the grieslie terrour, and in shape,<br/>
So speaking and so threatning, grew ten fold<br/>
More dreadful and deform: on th’ other side<br/>
Incenc’t with indignation <i>Satan</i> stood<br/>
Unterrifi’d, and like a Comet burn’d,<br/>
That fires the length of <i>Ophiucus</i> huge<br/>
In th’ Artick Sky, and from his horrid hair<br/>
Shakes Pestilence and Warr.  Each at the Head<br/>
Level’d his deadly aime; thir fatall hands<br/>
No second stroke intend, and such a frown<br/>
Each cast at th’ other, as when two black Clouds<br/>
With Heav’ns Artillery fraught, come rattling on<br/>
Over the <i>Caspian</i>, then stand front to front<br/>
Hov’ring a space, till Winds the signal blow<br/>
To joyn thir dark Encounter in mid air:<br/>
So frownd the mighty Combatants, that Hell<br/>
Grew darker at thir frown, so matcht they stood;<br/>
For never but once more was either like<br/>
To meet so great a foe: and now great deeds<br/>
Had been achiev’d, whereof all Hell had rung,<br/>
Had not the Snakie Sorceress that sat<br/>
Fast by Hell Gate, and kept the fatal Key,<br/>
Ris’n, and with hideous outcry rush’d between.<br/>
</p>
<p class="poem">
O Father, what intends thy hand, she cry’d,<br/>
Against thy only Son?  What fury O Son,<br/>

At thee ordain’d his drudge, to execute<br/>
What e’re his wrath, which he calls Justice, bids,<br/>
His wrath which one day will destroy ye both.<br/>

In this infernal Vaile first met thou call’st<br/>

T’ whom thus the Portress of Hell Gate reply’d;<br/>
Hast thou forgot me then, and do I seem<br/>
Now in thine eye so foul, once deemd so fair<br/>
In Heav’n, when at th’ Assembly, and in sight<br/>
Of all the Seraphim with thee combin’d<br/>
In bold conspiracy against Heav’ns King,<br/>
All on a sudden miserable pain<br/>
Surpris’d thee, dim thine eyes, and dizzie swumm<br/>
In darkness, while thy head flames thick and fast<br/>
Threw forth, till on the left side op’ning wide,<br/>
Likest to thee in shape and count’nance bright,<br/>
Then shining heav’nly fair, a Goddess arm’d<br/>
Out of thy head I sprung: amazement seis’d<br/>
All th’ Host of Heav’n; back they recoild affraid<br/>
At first, and call’d me <i>Sin</i>, and for a Sign<br/>
Portentous held me; but familiar grown,<br/>
I pleas’d, and with attractive graces won<br/>
The most averse, thee chiefly, who full oft<br/>
Thy self in me thy perfect image viewing<br/>
Becam’st enamour’d, and such joy thou took’st<br/>
With me in secret, that my womb conceiv’d<br/>
A growing burden.  Mean while Warr arose,<br/>
And fields were fought in Heav’n; wherein remaind<br/>
(For what could else) to our Almighty Foe<br/>
Cleer Victory, to our part loss and rout<br/>
Through all the Empyrean: down they fell<br/>
Driv’n headlong from the Pitch of Heaven, down<br/>
Into this Deep, and in the general fall<br/>
I also; at which time this powerful Key<br/>
Into my hand was giv’n, with charge to keep<br/>
These Gates for ever shut, which none can pass<br/>
Without my op’ning.  Pensive here I sat<br/>
Alone, but long I sat not, till my womb<br/>
Pregnant by thee, and now excessive grown<br/>
Prodigious motion felt and rueful throes.<br/>
At last this odious offspring whom thou seest<br/>
Thine own begotten, breaking violent way<br/>
Tore through my entrails, that with fear and pain<br/>
Distorted, all my nether shape thus grew<br/>
Transform’d: but he my inbred enemie<br/>
Forth issu’d, brandishing his fatal Dart<br/>
Made to destroy: I fled, and cry’d out <i>Death</i>;<br/>
Hell trembl’d at the hideous Name, and sigh’d<br/>
From all her Caves, and back resounded <i>Death</i>.<br/>
I fled, but he pursu’d (though more, it seems,<br/>
Inflam’d with lust then rage) and swifter far,<br/>
Me overtook his mother all dismaid,<br/>
And in embraces forcible and foule<br/>
Ingendring with me, of that rape begot<br/>
These yelling Monsters that with ceasless cry<br/>
Surround me, as thou sawst, hourly conceiv’d<br/>
And hourly born, with sorrow infinite<br/>
To me, for when they list into the womb<br/>
That bred them they return, and howle and gnaw<br/>
My Bowels, their repast; then bursting forth<br/>
Afresh with conscious terrours vex me round,<br/>
That rest or intermission none I find.<br/>
Before mine eyes in opposition sits<br/>
Grim <i>Death</i> my Son and foe, who sets them on,<br/>
And me his Parent would full soon devour<br/>
For want of other prey, but that he knows<br/>
His end with mine involvd; and knows that I<br/>
Should prove a bitter Morsel, and his bane,<br/>
When ever that shall be; so Fate pronounc’d.<br/>
But thou O Father, I forewarn thee, shun<br/>
His deadly arrow; neither vainly hope<br/>
To be invulnerable in those bright Arms,<br/>
Though temper’d heav’nly, for that mortal dint,<br/>
Save he who reigns above, none can resist.<br/>
</p>
<p class="poem">
She finish’d, and the suttle Fiend his lore<br/>
Soon learnd, now milder, and thus answerd smooth.<br/>
Dear Daughter, since thou claim’st me for thy Sire,<br/>
And my fair Son here showst me, the dear pledge<br/>
Of dalliance had with thee in Heav’n, and joys<br/>
Then sweet, now sad to mention, through dire change<br/>
Befalln us unforeseen, unthought of, know<br/>
I come no enemie, but to set free<br/>
From out this dark and dismal house of pain,<br/>
Both him and thee, and all the heav’nly Host<br/>
Of Spirits that in our just pretenses arm’d<br/>
Fell with us from on high: from them I go<br/>
This uncouth errand sole, and one for all<br/>
My self expose, with lonely steps to tread<br/>
Th’ unfounded deep, &amp; through the void immense<br/>
To search with wandring quest a place foretold<br/>
Should be, and, by concurring signs, ere now<br/>
Created vast and round, a place of bliss<br/>
In the Pourlieues of Heav’n, and therein plac’t<br/>
A race of upstart Creatures, to supply<br/>
Perhaps our vacant room, though more remov’d,<br/>
Least Heav’n surcharg’d with potent multitude<br/>
Might hap to move new broiles: Be this or aught<br/>
Then this more secret now design’d, I haste<br/>
To know, and this once known, shall soon return,<br/>
And bring ye to the place where Thou and Death<br/>
Shall dwell at ease, and up and down unseen<br/>
Wing silently the buxom Air, imbalm’d<br/>
With odours; there ye shall be fed and fill’d<br/>
Immeasurably, all things shall be your prey.<br/>
He ceas’d, for both seemd highly pleasd, and Death<br/>
Grinnd horrible a gastly smile, to hear<br/>
His famine should be fill’d, and blest his mawe<br/>
Destin’d to that good hour: no less rejoyc’d<br/>
His mother bad, and thus bespake her Sire.<br/>
</p>
<p class="poem">
The key of this infernal Pit by due,<br/>
And by command of Heav’ns all-powerful King<br/>

These Adamantine Gates; against all force<br/>
Death ready stands to interpose his dart,<br/>
Fearless to be o’rematcht by living might.<br/>
But what ow I to his commands above<br/>
Who hates me, and hath hither thrust me down<br/>
Into this gloom of <i>Tartarus</i> profound,<br/>
To sit in hateful Office here confin’d,<br/>
Inhabitant of Heav’n, and heav’nlie-born,<br/>
Here in perpetual agonie and pain,<br/>
With terrors and with clamors compasst round<br/>
Of mine own brood, that on my bowels feed:<br/>
Thou art my Father, thou my Author, thou<br/>
My being gav’st me; whom should I obey<br/>
But thee, whom follow? thou wilt bring me soon<br/>
To that new world of light and bliss, among<br/>
The Gods who live at ease, where I shall Reign<br/>
At thy right hand voluptuous, as beseems<br/>
Thy daughter and thy darling, without end.<br/>

<p class="poem">
Thus saying, from her side the fatal Key,<br/>
Sad instrument of all our woe, she took;<br/>
And towards the Gate rouling her bestial train,<br/>
Forthwith the huge Porcullis high up drew,<br/>
Which but her self not all the <i>Stygian</i> powers<br/>
Could once have mov’d; then in the key-hole turns<br/>
Th’ intricate wards, and every Bolt and Bar<br/>
Of massie Iron or sollid Rock with ease<br/>
Unfast’ns: on a sudden op’n flie<br/>
With impetuous recoile and jarring sound<br/>
Th’ infernal dores, and on thir hinges great<br/>
Harsh Thunder, that the lowest bottom shook<br/>
Of <i>Erebus</i>.  She op’nd, but to shut<br/>
Excel’d her power; the Gates wide op’n stood,<br/>
That with extended wings a Bannerd Host<br/>
Under spread Ensigns marching might pass through<br/>
With Horse and Chariots rankt in loose array;<br/>
So wide they stood, and like a Furnace mouth<br/>
Cast forth redounding smoak and ruddy flame.<br/>
Before thir eyes in sudden view appear<br/>
The secrets of the hoarie deep, a dark<br/>
Illimitable Ocean without bound,<br/>
Without dimension, where length, breadth, and highth,<br/>
And time and place are lost; where eldest Night<br/>
And <i>Chaos</i>, Ancestors of Nature, hold<br/>
Eternal <i>Anarchie</i>, amidst the noise<br/>
Of endless warrs and by confusion stand.<br/>
For hot, cold, moist, and dry, four Champions fierce<br/>
Strive here for Maistrie, and to Battel bring<br/>
Thir embryon Atoms; they around the flag<br/>
Of each his faction, in thir several Clanns,<br/>
Light-arm’d or heavy, sharp, smooth, swift or slow,<br/>
Swarm populous, unnumber’d as the Sands<br/>
Of <i>Barca</i> or <i>Cyrene’s</i> torrid soil,<br/>
Levied to side with warring Winds, and poise<br/>
Thir lighter wings.  To whom these most adhere,<br/>
Hee rules a moment; <i>Chaos</i> Umpire sits,<br/>
And by decision more imbroiles the fray<br/>
By which he Reigns: next him high Arbiter<br/>
<i>Chance</i> governs all.  Into this wilde Abyss,<br/>
The Womb of nature and perhaps her Grave,<br/>
Of neither Sea, nor Shore, nor Air, nor Fire,<br/>
But all these in thir pregnant causes mixt<br/>
Confus’dly, and which thus must ever fight,<br/>
Unless th’ Almighty Maker them ordain<br/>
His dark materials to create more Worlds,<br/>
Into this wilde Abyss the warie fiend<br/>
Stood on the brink of Hell and look’d a while,<br/>
Pondering his Voyage; for no narrow frith<br/>
He had to cross.  Nor was his eare less peal’d<br/>
With noises loud and ruinous (to compare<br/>
Great things with small) then when <i>Bellona</i> storms,<br/>
With all her battering Engines bent to rase<br/>
Som Capital City, or less then if this frame<br/>
Of Heav’n were falling, and these Elements<br/>
In mutinie had from her Axle torn<br/>
The stedfast Earth.  At last his Sail-broad Vannes<br/>
He spreads for flight, and in the surging smoak<br/>
Uplifted spurns the ground, thence many a League<br/>
As in a cloudy Chair ascending rides<br/>
Audacious, but that seat soon failing, meets<br/>
A vast vacuitie: all unawares<br/>
Fluttring his pennons vain plumb down he drops<br/>
Ten thousand fadom deep, and to this hour<br/>
Down had been falling, had not by ill chance<br/>
The strong rebuff of som tumultuous cloud<br/>
Instinct with Fire and Nitre hurried him<br/>
As many miles aloft: that furie stay’d,<br/>
Quencht in a Boggie <i>Syrtris</i>, neither Sea,<br/>
Nor good dry Land: nigh founderd on he fares,<br/>
Treading the crude consistence, half on foot,<br/>
Half flying; behoves him now both Oare and Saile.<br/>
As when a Gryfon through the Wilderness<br/>
With winged course ore Hill or moarie Dale,<br/>
Pursues the <i>Arimaspian</i>, who by stelth<br/>
Had from his wakeful custody purloind<br/>
The guarded Gold: So eagerly the fiend<br/>
Ore bog or steep, through strait, rough, dense, or rare,<br/>
With head, hands, wings, or feet pursues his way,<br/>
And swims or sinks, or wades, or creeps, or flyes:<br/>
At length a universal hubbub wilde<br/>
Of stunning sounds and voices all confus’d<br/>
Born through the hollow dark assaults his eare<br/>
With loudest vehemence: thither he plyes,<br/>
Undaunted to meet there what ever power<br/>
Or Spirit of the nethermost Abyss<br/>
Might in that noise reside, of whom to ask<br/>
Which way the neerest coast of darkness lyes<br/>
Bordering on light; when strait behold the Throne<br/>
Of <i>Chaos</i>, and his dark Pavilion spread<br/>
Wide on the wasteful Deep; with him Enthron’d<br/>
Sat Sable-vested Night, eldest of things,<br/>
The consort of his Reign; and by them stood<br/>
<i>Orcus</i> and <i>Ades</i>, and the dreaded name<br/>
Of <i>Demogorgon</i>; Rumor next and Chance,<br/>
And Tumult and Confusion all imbroild,<br/>
And Discord with a thousand various mouths.<br/>
</p>
<p class="poem">
T’ whom <i>Satan</i> turning boldly, thus.  Ye Powers<br/>
And Spirits of this nethermost Abyss,<br/>
<i>Chaos</i> and <i>Ancient Night</i>, I come no Spie,<br/>
With purpose to explore or to disturb<br/>
The secrets of your Realm, but by constraint<br/>
Wandring this darksome desart, as my way<br/>
Lies through your spacious Empire up to light,<br/>
Alone, and without guide, half lost, I seek<br/>
What readiest path leads where your gloomie bounds<br/>
Confine with Heav’n; or if som other place<br/>
From your Dominion won, th’ Ethereal King<br/>
Possesses lately, thither to arrive<br/>
I travel this profound, direct my course;<br/>
Directed, no mean recompence it brings<br/>
To your behoof, if I that Region lost,<br/>
All usurpation thence expell’d, reduce<br/>
To her original darkness and your sway<br/>
(Which is my present journey) and once more<br/>
Erect the Standerd there of <i>Ancient Night</i>;<br/>
Yours be th’ advantage all, mine the revenge.<br/>

Thus <i>Satan</i>; and him thus the Anarch old<br/>
With faultring speech and visage incompos’d<br/>
Answer’d.  I know thee, stranger, who thou art,<br/>
That mighty leading Angel, who of late<br/>
Made head against Heav’ns King, though overthrown.<br/>
I saw and heard, for such a numerous host<br/>
Fled not in silence through the frighted deep<br/>
With ruin upon ruin, rout on rout,<br/>
Confusion worse confounded; and Heav’n Gates<br/>
Pourd out by millions her victorious Bands<br/>
Pursuing.  I upon my Frontieres here<br/>
Keep residence; if all I can will serve,<br/>
That little which is left so to defend<br/>
Encroacht on still through our intestine broiles<br/>
Weakning the Scepter of old Night: first Hell<br/>
Your dungeon stretching far and wide beneath;<br/>
Now lately Heaven and Earth, another World<br/>
Hung ore my Realm, link’d in a golden Chain<br/>
To that side Heav’n from whence your Legions fell:<br/>
If that way be your walk, you have not farr;<br/>
So much the neerer danger; goe and speed;<br/>
Havock and spoil and ruin are my gain.<br/>

<p class="poem">
He ceas’d; and <i>Satan</i> staid not to reply,<br/>
But glad that now his Sea should find a shore,<br/>
With fresh alacritie and force renew’d<br/>
Springs upward like a Pyramid of fire<br/>
Into the wilde expanse, and through the shock<br/>
Of fighting Elements, on all sides round<br/>
Environ’d wins his way; harder beset<br/>
And more endanger’d, then when <i>Argo</i> pass’d<br/>
Through <i>Bosporus</i> betwixt the justling Rocks:<br/>
Or when <i>Ulysses</i> on the Larbord shunnd<br/>
<i>Charybdis</i>, and by th’ other whirlpool steard.<br/>
So he with difficulty and labour hard<br/>
Mov’d on, with difficulty and labour hee;<br/>
But hee once past, soon after when man fell,<br/>
Strange alteration!  Sin and Death amain<br/>
Following his track, such was the will of Heav’n,<br/>
Pav’d after him a broad and beat’n way<br/>
Over the dark Abyss, whose boiling Gulf<br/>
Tamely endur’d a Bridge of wondrous length<br/>
From Hell continu’d reaching th’ utmost Orbe<br/>
Of this frail World; by which the Spirits perverse<br/>
With easie intercourse pass to and fro<br/>
To tempt or punish mortals, except whom<br/>
God and good Angels guard by special grace.<br/>
But now at last the sacred influence<br/>
Of light appears, and from the walls of Heav’n<br/>
Shoots farr into the bosom of dim Night<br/>
A glimmering dawn; here Nature first begins<br/>
Her fardest verge, and <i>Chaos</i> to retire<br/>
As from her outmost works a brok’n foe<br/>
With tumult less and with less hostile din,<br/>
That <i>Satan</i> with less toil, and now with ease<br/>
Wafts on the calmer wave by dubious light<br/>
And like a weather-beaten Vessel holds<br/>
Gladly the Port, though Shrouds and Tackle torn;<br/>
Or in the emptier waste, resembling Air,<br/>
Weighs his spread wings, at leasure to behold<br/>
Farr off th’ Empyreal Heav’n, extended wide<br/>
In circuit, undetermind square or round,<br/>
With Opal Towrs and Battlements adorn’d<br/>
Of living Saphire, once his native Seat;<br/>
And fast by hanging in a golden Chain<br/>
This pendant world, in bigness as a Starr<br/>
Of smallest Magnitude close by the Moon.<br/>
Thither full fraught with mischievous revenge,<br/>
Accurst, and in a cursed hour he hies.<br/>
