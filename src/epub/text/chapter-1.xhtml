						<span>Of Man’s First Disobedience, and the Fruit</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of that Forbidden Tree, whose mortal tast</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Brought Death into the World, and all our woe,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>With loss of <i>Eden</i>, till one greater Man</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Restore us, and regain the blissful Seat,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Sing Heav’nly Muse, that on the secret top</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of <i>Oreb</i>, or of <i>Sinai</i>, didst inspire</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That Shepherd, who first taught the chosen Seed,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>In the Beginning how the Heav’ns and Earth</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Rose out of <i>Chaos</i>: Or if <i>Sion</i> Hill</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Delight thee more, and <i>Siloa’s</i> Brook that flow’d</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Fast by the Oracle of God; I thence</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Invoke thy aid to my adventrous Song,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That with no middle flight intends to soar</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Above th’ <i>Aonian</i> Mount, while it pursues</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Things unattempted yet in Prose or Rhime.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And chiefly Thou O Spirit, that dost prefer</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Before all Temples th’ upright heart and pure,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Instruct me, for Thou know’st; Thou from the first</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Wast present, and with mighty wings outspread</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Dove-like satst brooding on the vast Abyss</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And mad’st it pregnant: What in me is dark</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Illumine, what is low raise and support;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That to the highth of this great Argument</span>
						<br/>
						<span>I may assert th’ Eternal Providence,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And justifie the wayes of God to men.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>Say first, for Heav’n hides nothing from thy view</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Nor the deep Tract of Hell, say first what cause</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Mov’d our Grand Parents in that happy State,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Favour’d of Heav’n so highly, to fall off</span>
						<br/>
						<span>From their Creator, and transgress his Will</span>
						<br/>
						<span>For one restraint, Lords of the World besides?</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Who first seduc’d them to that fowl revolt?</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Th’ infernal Serpent; he it was, whose guile</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Stird up with Envy and Revenge, deceiv’d</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The Mother of Mankinde, what time his Pride</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Had cast him out from Heav’n, with all his Host</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of Rebel Angels, by whose aid aspiring</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To set himself in Glory above his Peers,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>He trusted to have equal’d the most High,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>If he oppos’d; and with ambitious aim</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Against the Throne and Monarchy of God</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Rais’d impious War in Heav’n and Battel proud</span>
						<br/>
						<span>With vain attempt.  Him the Almighty Power</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Hurld headlong flaming from th’ Ethereal Skie</span>
						<br/>
						<span>With hideous ruine and combustion down</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To bottomless perdition, there to dwell</span>
						<br/>
						<span>In Adamantine Chains and penal Fire,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Who durst defie th’ Omnipotent to Arms.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Nine times the Space that measures Day and Night</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To mortal men, he with his horrid crew</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Lay vanquisht, rowling in the fiery Gulfe</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Confounded though immortal: But his doom</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Reserv’d him to more wrath; for now the thought</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Both of lost happiness and lasting pain</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Torments him; round he throws his baleful eyes</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That witness’d huge affliction and dismay</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Mixt with obdurate pride and stedfast hate:</span>
						<br/>
						<span>At once as far as Angels kenn he views</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The dismal Situation waste and wilde,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A Dungeon horrible, on all sides round</span>
						<br/>
						<span>As one great Furnace flam’d, yet from those flames</span>
						<br/>
						<span>No light, but rather darkness visible</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Serv’d only to discover sights of woe,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Regions of sorrow, doleful shades, where peace</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And rest can never dwell, hope never comes</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That comes to all; but torture without end</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Still urges, and a fiery Deluge, fed</span>
						<br/>
						<span>With ever-burning Sulphur unconsum’d:</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Such place Eternal Justice had prepar’d</span>
						<br/>
						<span>For those rebellious, here their Prison ordain’d</span>
						<br/>
						<span>In utter darkness, and their portion set</span>
						<br/>
						<span>As far remov’d from God and light of Heav’n</span>
						<br/>
						<span>As from the Center thrice to th’ utmost Pole.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>O how unlike the place from whence they fell!</span>
						<br/>
						<span>There the companions of his fall, o’rewhelm’d</span>
						<br/>
						<span>With Floods and Whirlwinds of tempestuous fire,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>He soon discerns, and weltring by his side</span>
						<br/>
						<span>One next himself in power, and next in crime,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Long after known in <i>Palestine</i>, and nam’d</span>
						<br/>
						<span><i>Beelzebub</i>.  To whom th’ Arch-Enemy,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And thence in Heav’n call’d Satan, with bold words</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Breaking the horrid silence thus began.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>If thou beest he; But O how fall’n! how chang’d</span>
						<br/>
						<span>From him, who in the happy Realms of Light</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Cloth’d with transcendent brightnes didst outshine</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Myriads though bright: If he whom mutual league,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>United thoughts and counsels, equal hope,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And hazard in the Glorious Enterprize,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Joynd with me once, now misery hath joynd</span>
						<br/>
						<span>In equal ruin: into what Pit thou seest</span>
						<br/>
						<span>From what highth fal’n, so much the stronger provd</span>
						<br/>
						<span>He with his Thunder: and till then who knew</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The force of those dire Arms? yet not for those</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Nor what the Potent Victor in his rage</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Can else inflict do I repent or change,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Though chang’d in outward lustre; that fixt mind</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And high disdain, from sence of injur’d merit,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That with the mightiest rais’d me to contend,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And to the fierce contention brought along</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Innumerable force of Spirits arm’d</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That durst dislike his reign, and me preferring,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>His utmost power with adverse power oppos’d</span>
						<br/>
						<span>In dubious Battel on the Plains of Heav’n,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And shook his throne.  What though the field be lost?</span>
						<br/>
						<span>All is not lost; the unconquerable Will,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And study of revenge, immortal hate,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And courage never to submit or yield:</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And what is else not to be overcome?</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That Glory never shall his wrath or might</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Extort from me.  To bow and sue for grace</span>
						<br/>
						<span>With suppliant knee, and deifie his power</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Who from the terrour of this Arm so late</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Doubted his Empire, that were low indeed,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That were an ignominy and shame beneath</span>
						<br/>
						<span>This downfall; since by Fate the strength of Gods</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And this Empyreal substance cannot fail,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Since through experience of this great event</span>
						<br/>
						<span>In Arms not worse, in foresight much advanc’t,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>We may with more successful hope resolve</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To wage by force or guile eternal Warr</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Irreconcileable, to our grand Foe,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Who now triumphs, and in th’ excess of joy</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Sole reigning holds the Tyranny of Heav’n.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>So spake th’ Apostate Angel, though in pain,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Vaunting aloud, but rackt with deep despare:</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And him thus answer’d soon his bold Compeer.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>O Prince, O Chief of many Throned Powers,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That led th’ imbattelld Seraphim to Warr</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Under thy conduct, and in dreadful deeds</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Fearless, endanger’d Heav’ns perpetual King;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And put to proof his high Supremacy,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Whether upheld by strength, or Chance, or Fate,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Too well I see and rue the dire event,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That with sad overthrow and foul defeat</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Hath lost us Heav’n, and all this mighty Host</span>
						<br/>
						<span>In horrible destruction laid thus low,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>As far as Gods and Heav’nly Essences</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Can Perish: for the mind and spirit remains</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Invincible, and vigour soon returns,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Though all our Glory extinct, and happy state</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Here swallow’d up in endless misery.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>But what if he our Conquerour, (whom I now</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of force believe Almighty, since no less</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Then such could hav orepow’rd such force as ours)</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Have left us this our spirit and strength intire</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Strongly to suffer and support our pains,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That we may so suffice his vengeful ire,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Or do him mightier service as his thralls</span>
						<br/>
						<span>By right of Warr, what e’re his business be</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Here in the heart of Hell to work in Fire,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Or do his Errands in the gloomy Deep;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>What can it then avail though yet we feel</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Strength undiminisht, or eternal being</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To undergo eternal punishment?</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Whereto with speedy words th’ Arch-fiend reply’d.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>Fall’n Cherube, to be weak is miserable</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Doing or Suffering: but of this be sure,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To do ought good never will be our task,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>But ever to do ill our sole delight,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>As being the contrary to his high will</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Whom we resist.  If then his Providence</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Out of our evil seek to bring forth good,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Our labour must be to pervert that end,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And out of good still to find means of evil;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Which oft times may succeed, so as perhaps</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Shall grieve him, if I fail not, and disturb</span>
						<br/>
						<span>His inmost counsels from their destind aim.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>But see the angry Victor hath recall’d</span>
						<br/>
						<span>His Ministers of vengeance and pursuit</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Back to the Gates of Heav’n: The Sulphurous Hail</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Shot after us in storm, oreblown hath laid</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The fiery Surge, that from the Precipice</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of Heav’n receiv’d us falling, and the Thunder,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Wing’d with red Lightning and impetuous rage,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Perhaps hath spent his shafts, and ceases now</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To bellow through the vast and boundless Deep.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Let us not slip th’ occasion, whether scorn,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Or satiate fury yield it from our Foe.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Seest thou yon dreary Plain, forlorn and wilde,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The seat of desolation, voyd of light,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Save what the glimmering of these livid flames</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Casts pale and dreadful?  Thither let us tend</span>
						<br/>
						<span>From off the tossing of these fiery waves,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>There rest, if any rest can harbour there,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And reassembling our afflicted Powers,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Consult how we may henceforth most offend</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Our Enemy, our own loss how repair,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>How overcome this dire Calamity,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>What reinforcement we may gain from Hope,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>If not what resolution from despare.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>Thus Satan talking to his neerest Mate</span>
						<br/>
						<span>With Head up-lift above the wave, and Eyes</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That sparkling blaz’d, his other Parts besides</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Prone on the Flood, extended long and large</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Lay floating many a rood, in bulk as huge</span>
						<br/>
						<span>As whom the Fables name of monstrous size,</span>
						<br/>
						<span><i>Titanian</i>, or <i>Earth-born</i>, that warr’d on <i>Jove</i>,</span>
						<br/>
						<span><i>Briarios</i> or <i>Typhon</i>, whom the Den</span>
						<br/>
						<span>By ancient <i>Tarsus</i> held, or that Sea-beast</span>
						<br/>
						<span><i>Leviathan</i>, which God of all his works</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Created hugest that swim th’ Ocean stream:</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Him haply slumbring on the <i>Norway</i> foam</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The Pilot of some small night-founder’d Skiff,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Deeming some Island, oft, as Sea-men tell,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>With fixed Anchor in his skaly rind</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Moors by his side under the Lee, while Night</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Invests the Sea, and wished Morn delayes:</span>
						<br/>
						<span>So stretcht out huge in length the Arch-fiend lay</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Chain’d on the burning Lake, nor ever thence</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Had ris’n or heav’d his head, but that the will</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And high permission of all-ruling Heaven</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Left him at large to his own dark designs,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That with reiterated crimes he might</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Heap on himself damnation, while he sought</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Evil to others, and enrag’d might see</span>
						<br/>
						<span>How all his malice serv’d but to bring forth</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Infinite goodness, grace and mercy shewn</span>
						<br/>
						<span>On Man by him seduc’t, but on himself</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Treble confusion, wrath and vengeance pour’d.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Forthwith upright he rears from off the Pool</span>
						<br/>
						<span>His mighty Stature; on each hand the flames</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Drivn backward slope their pointing spires, &amp; rowld</span>
						<br/>
						<span>In billows, leave i’th’ midst a horrid Vale.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Then with expanded wings he stears his flight</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Aloft, incumbent on the dusky Air</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That felt unusual weight, till on dry Land</span>
						<br/>
						<span>He lights, if it were Land that ever burn’d</span>
						<br/>
						<span>With solid, as the Lake with liquid fire;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And such appear’d in hue, as when the force</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of subterranean wind transports a Hill</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Torn from <i>Pelorus</i>, or the shatter’d side</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of thundring <i>Aetna</i>, whose combustible</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And fewel’d entrals thence conceiving Fire,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Sublim’d with Mineral fury, aid the Winds,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And leave a singed bottom all involv’d</span>
						<br/>
						<span>With stench and smoak: Such resting found the sole</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of unblest feet.  Him followed his next Mate,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Both glorying to have scap’t the <i>Stygian</i> flood</span>
						<br/>
						<span>As Gods, and by their own recover’d strength,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Not by the sufferance of supernal Power.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>Is this the Region, this the Soil, the Clime,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Said then the lost Arch Angel, this the seat</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That we must change for Heav’n, this mournful gloom</span>
						<br/>
						<span>For that celestial light?  Be it so, since hee</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Who now is Sovran can dispose and bid</span>
						<br/>
						<span>What shall be right: fardest from him is best</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Whom reason hath equald, force hath made supream</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Above his equals.  Farewel happy Fields</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Where Joy for ever dwells: Hail horrours, hail</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Infernal world, and thou profoundest Hell</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Receive thy new Possessor: One who brings</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A mind not to be chang’d by Place or Time.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The mind is its own place, and in it self</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Can make a Heav’n of Hell, a Hell of Heav’n.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>What matter where, if I be still the same,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And what I should be, all but less then hee</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Whom Thunder hath made greater?  Here at least</span>
						<br/>
						<span>We shall be free; th’ Almighty hath not built</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Here for his envy, will not drive us hence:</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Here we may reign secure, and in my choyce</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To reign is worth ambition though in Hell:</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Better to reign in Hell, then serve in Heav’n.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>But wherefore let we then our faithful friends,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Th’ associates and copartners of our loss</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Lye thus astonisht on th’ oblivious Pool,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And call them not to share with us their part</span>
						<br/>
						<span>In this unhappy Mansion, or once more</span>
						<br/>
						<span>With rallied Arms to try what may be yet</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Regaind in Heav’n, or what more lost in Hell?</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>So <i>Satan</i> spake, and him <i>Beelzebub</i></span>
						<br/>
						<span>Thus answer’d.  Leader of those Armies bright,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Which but th’ Omnipotent none could have foyld,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>If once they hear that voyce, their liveliest pledge</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of hope in fears and dangers, heard so oft</span>
						<br/>
						<span>In worst extreams, and on the perilous edge</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of battel when it rag’d, in all assaults</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Their surest signal, they will soon resume</span>
						<br/>
						<span>New courage and revive, though now they lye</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Groveling and prostrate on yon Lake of Fire,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>As we erewhile, astounded and amaz’d,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>No wonder, fall’n such a pernicious highth.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>He scarce had ceas’t when the superiour Fiend</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Was moving toward the shore; his ponderous shield</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Ethereal temper, massy, large and round,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Behind him cast; the broad circumference</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Hung on his shoulders like the Moon, whose Orb</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Through Optic Glass the <i>Tuscan</i> Artist views</span>
						<br/>
						<span>At Ev’ning from the top of <i>Fesole</i>,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Or in <i>Valdarno</i>, to descry new Lands,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Rivers or Mountains in her spotty Globe.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>His Spear, to equal which the tallest Pine</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Hewn on <i>Norwegian</i> hills, to be the Mast</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of some great Ammiral, were but a wand,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>He walkt with to support uneasie steps</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Over the burning Marle, not like those steps</span>
						<br/>
						<span>On Heavens Azure, and the torrid Clime</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Smote on him sore besides, vaulted with Fire;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Nathless he so endur’d, till on the Beach</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of that inflamed Sea, he stood and call’d</span>
						<br/>
						<span>His Legions, Angel Forms, who lay intrans’t</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Thick as Autumnal Leaves that strow the Brooks</span>
						<br/>
						<span>In <i>Vallombrosa</i>, where th’ <i>Etrurian</i> shades</span>
						<br/>
						<span>High overarch’t imbowr; or scatterd sedge</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Afloat, when with fierce Winds <i>Orion</i> arm’d</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Hath vext the Red-Sea Coast, whose waves orethrew</span>
						<br/>
						<span><i>Busiris</i> and his <i>Memphian</i> Chivalrie,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>VVhile with perfidious hatred they pursu’d</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The Sojourners of <i>Goshen</i>, who beheld</span>
						<br/>
						<span>From the safe shore their floating Carkases</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And broken Chariot Wheels, so thick bestrown</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Abject and lost lay these, covering the Flood,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Under amazement of their hideous change.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>He call’d so loud, that all the hollow Deep</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of Hell resounded.  Princes, Potentates,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Warriers, the Flowr of Heav’n, once yours, now lost,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>If such astonishment as this can sieze</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Eternal spirits; or have ye chos’n this place</span>
						<br/>
						<span>After the toyl of Battel to repose</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Your wearied vertue, for the ease you find</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To slumber here, as in the Vales of Heav’n?</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Or in this abject posture have ye sworn</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To adore the Conquerour? who now beholds</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Cherube and Seraph rowling in the Flood</span>
						<br/>
						<span>With scatter’d Arms and Ensigns, till anon</span>
						<br/>
						<span>His swift pursuers from Heav’n Gates discern</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Th’ advantage, and descending tread us down</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Thus drooping, or with linked Thunderbolts</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Transfix us to the bottom of this Gulfe.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Awake, arise, or be for ever fall’n.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>They heard, and were abasht, and up they sprung</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Upon the wing, as when men wont to watch</span>
						<br/>
						<span>On duty, sleeping found by whom they dread,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Rouse and bestir themselves ere well awake.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Nor did they not perceave the evil plight</span>
						<br/>
						<span>In which they were, or the fierce pains not feel;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Yet to their Generals Voyce they soon obeyd</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Innumerable.  As when the potent Rod</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of <i>Amrams</i> Son in <i>Egypts</i> evill day</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Wav’d round the Coast, up call’d a pitchy cloud</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of <i>Locusts</i>, warping on the Eastern Wind,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That ore the Realm of impious <i>Pharoah</i> hung</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Like Night, and darken’d all the Land of <i>Nile</i>:</span>
						<br/>
						<span>So numberless were those bad Angels seen</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Hovering on wing under the Cope of Hell</span>
						<br/>
						<span>’Twixt upper, nether, and surrounding Fires;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Till, as a signal giv’n, th’ uplifted Spear</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of their great Sultan waving to direct</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Thir course, in even ballance down they light</span>
						<br/>
						<span>On the firm brimstone, and fill all the Plain;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A multitude, like which the populous North</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Pour’d never from her frozen loyns, to pass</span>
						<br/>
						<span><i>Rhene</i> or the <i>Danaw</i>, when her barbarous Sons</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Came like a Deluge on the South, and spread</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Beneath <i>Gibraltar</i> to the <i>Lybian</i> sands.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Forthwith from every Squadron and each Band</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The Heads and Leaders thither hast where stood</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Their great Commander; Godlike shapes and forms</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Excelling human, Princely Dignities,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And Powers that earst in Heaven sat on Thrones;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Though of their Names in heav’nly Records now</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Be no memorial, blotted out and ras’d</span>
						<br/>
						<span>By thir Rebellion, from the Books of Life.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Nor had they yet among the Sons of <i>Eve</i></span>
						<br/>
						<span>Got them new Names, till wandring ore the Earth,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Through Gods high sufferance for the tryal of man,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>By falsities and lyes the greatest part</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of Mankind they corrupted to forsake</span>
						<br/>
						<span>God their Creator, and th’ invisible</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Glory of him, that made them, to transform</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Oft to the Image of a Brute, adorn’d</span>
						<br/>
						<span>With gay Religions full of Pomp and Gold,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And Devils to adore for Deities:</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Then were they known to men by various Names,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And various Idols through the Heathen World.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Say, Muse, their Names then known, who first, who last,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Rous’d from the slumber, on that fiery Couch,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>At thir great Emperors call, as next in worth</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Came singly where he stood on the bare strand,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>While the promiscuous croud stood yet aloof?</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The chief were those who from the Pit of Hell</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Roaming to seek their prey on earth, durst fix</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Their Seats long after next the Seat of God,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Their Altars by his Altar, Gods ador’d</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Among the Nations round, and durst abide</span>
						<br/>
						<span><i>Jehovah</i> thundring out of <i>Sion</i>, thron’d</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Between the Cherubim; yea, often plac’d</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Within his Sanctuary it self their Shrines,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Abominations; and with cursed things</span>
						<br/>
						<span>His holy Rites, and solemn Feasts profan’d,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And with their darkness durst affront his light.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>First <i>Moloch</i>, horrid King besmear’d with blood</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of human sacrifice, and parents tears,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Though for the noyse of Drums and Timbrels loud</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Their childrens cries unheard, that past through fire</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To his grim Idol.  Him the <i>Ammonite</i></span>
						<br/>
						<span>Worshipt in <i>Rabba</i> and her watry Plain,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>In <i>Argob</i> and in <i>Basan</i>, to the stream</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of utmost <i>Arnon</i>.  Nor content with such</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Audacious neighbourhood, the wisest heart</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of <i>Solomon</i> he led by fraud to build</span>
						<br/>
						<span>His Temple right against the Temple of God</span>
						<br/>
						<span>On that opprobrious Hill, and made his Grove</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The pleasant Vally of <i>Hinnom</i>, <i>Tophet</i> thence</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And black <i>Gehenna</i> call’d, the Type of Hell.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Next <i>Chemos</i>, th’ obscene dread of <i>Moabs</i> Sons,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>From <i>Aroer</i> to <i>Nebo</i>, and the wild</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of Southmost <i>Abarim</i>; in <i>Hesebon</i></span>
						<br/>
						<span>And <i>Heronaim</i>, <i>Seons</i> Realm, beyond</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The flowry Dale of <i>Sibma</i> clad with Vines,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And <i>Eleale</i> to th’ <i>Asphaltick</i> Pool.</span>
						<br/>
						<span><i>Peor</i> his other Name, when he entic’d</span>
						<br/>
						<span><i>Israel</i> in <i>Sittim</i> on their march from <i>Nile</i></span>
						<br/>
						<span>To do him wanton rites, which cost them woe.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Yet thence his lustful Orgies he enlarg’d</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Even to that Hill of scandal, by the Grove</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of <i>Moloch</i> homicide, lust hard by hate;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Till good <i>Josiah</i> drove them thence to Hell.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>With these came they, who from the bordring flood</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of old <i>Euphrates</i> to the Brook that parts</span>
						<br/>
						<span><i>Egypt</i> from <i>Syrian</i> ground, had general Names</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of <i>Baalim</i> and <i>Ashtaroth</i>, those male,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>These Feminine.  For Spirits when they please</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Can either Sex assume, or both; so soft</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And uncompounded is their Essence pure,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Not ti’d or manacl’d with joynt or limb,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Nor founded on the brittle strength of bones,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Like cumbrous flesh; but in what shape they choose</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Dilated or condens’t, bright or obscure,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Can execute their aerie purposes,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And works of love or enmity fulfill.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>For those the Race of <i>Israel</i> oft forsook</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Their living strength, and unfrequented left</span>
						<br/>
						<span>His righteous Altar, bowing lowly down</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To bestial Gods; for which their heads as low</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Bow’d down in Battel, sunk before the Spear</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of despicable foes.  With these in troop</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Came <i>Astoreth</i>, whom the <i>Phoenicians</i> call’d</span>
						<br/>
						<span><i>Astarte</i>, Queen of Heav’n, with crescent Horns;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To whose bright Image nightly by the Moon</span>
						<br/>
						<span><i>Sidonian</i> Virgins paid their Vows and Songs,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>In <i>Sion</i> also not unsung, where stood</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Her Temple on th’ offensive Mountain, built</span>
						<br/>
						<span>By that uxorious King, whose heart though large,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Beguil’d by fair Idolatresses, fell</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To Idols foul. <i>Thammuz</i> came next behind,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Whose annual wound in <i>Lebanon</i> allur’d</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The <i>Syrian</i> Damsels to lament his fate</span>
						<br/>
						<span>In amorous dittyes all a Summers day,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>While smooth <i>Adonis</i> from his native Rock</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Ran purple to the Sea, suppos’d with blood</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of <i>Thammuz</i> yearly wounded: the Love-tale</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Infected <i>Sions</i> daughters with like heat,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Whose wanton passions in the sacred Porch</span>
						<br/>
						<span><i>Ezekiel</i> saw, when by the Vision led</span>
						<br/>
						<span>His eye survay’d the dark Idolatries</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of alienated <i>Judah</i>.  Next came one</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Who mourn’d in earnest, when the Captive Ark</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Maim’d his brute Image, head and hands lopt off</span>
						<br/>
						<span>In his own Temple, on the grunsel edge,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Where he fell flat, and sham’d his Worshipers:</span>
						<br/>
						<span><i>Dagon</i> his Name, Sea Monster, upward Man</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And downward Fish: yet had his Temple high</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Rear’d in <i>Azotus</i>, dreaded through the Coast</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of <i>Palestine</i>, in <i>Gath</i> and <i>Ascalon</i>,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And <i>Accaron</i> and <i>Gaza’s</i> frontier bounds.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Him follow’d <i>Rimmon</i>, whose delightful Seat</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Was fair <i>Damscus</i>, on the fertil Banks</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of <i>Abbana</i> and <i>Pharphar</i>, lucid streams.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>He also against the house of God was bold:</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A Leper once he lost and gain’d a King,</span>
						<br/>
						<span><i>Ahaz</i> his sottish Conquerour, whom he drew</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Gods Altar to disparage and displace</span>
						<br/>
						<span>For one of <i>Syrian</i> mode, whereon to burn</span>
						<br/>
						<span>His odious offrings, and adore the Gods</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Whom he had vanquisht. After these appear’d</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A crew who under Names of old Renown,</span>
						<br/>
						<span><i>Osiris</i>, <i>Isis</i>, <i>Orus</i> and their Train</span>
						<br/>
						<span>With monstrous shapes and sorceries abus’d</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Fanatic <i>Egypt</i> and her Priests, to seek</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Thir wandring Gods disguis’d in brutish forms</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Rather then human.  Nor did <i>Israel</i> scape</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Th’ infection when their borrow’d Gold compos’d</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The Calf in <i>Oreb</i>: and the Rebel King</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Doubl’d that sin in <i>Bethel</i> and in <i>Dan</i>,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Lik’ning his Maker to the Grazed Ox,</span>
						<br/>
						<span><i>Jehovah</i>, who in one Night when he pass’d</span>
						<br/>
						<span>From <i>Egypt</i> marching, equal’d with one stroke</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Both her first born and all her bleating Gods.</span>
						<br/>
						<span><i>Belial</i> came last, then whom a Spirit more lewd</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Fell not from Heaven, or more gross to love</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Vice for it self: To him no Temple stood</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Or Altar smoak’d; yet who more oft then hee</span>
						<br/>
						<span>In Temples and at Altars, when the Priest</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Turns Atheist, as did <i>Ely’s</i> Sons, who fill’d</span>
						<br/>
						<span>With lust and violence the house of God.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>In Courts and Palaces he also Reigns</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And in luxurious Cities, where the noyse</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of riot ascends above thir loftiest Towrs,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And injury and outrage: And when Night</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Darkens the Streets, then wander forth the Sons</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of <i>Belial</i>, flown with insolence and wine.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Witness the Streets of <i>Sodom</i>, and that night</span>
						<br/>
						<span>In <i>Gibeah</i>, when hospitable Dores</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Yielded thir Matrons to prevent worse rape.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>These were the prime in order and in might;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The rest were long to tell, though far renown’d,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Th’ <i>Ionian</i> Gods, of <i>Javans</i> Issue held</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Gods, yet confest later then Heav’n and Earth</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Thir boasted Parents; <i>Titian</i> Heav’ns first born</span>
						<br/>
						<span>With his enormous brood, and birthright seis’d</span>
						<br/>
						<span>By younger <i>Saturn</i>, he from mightier <i>Jove</i></span>
						<br/>
						<span>His own and <i>Rhea’s</i> Son like measure found;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>So <i>Jove</i> usurping reign’d: these first in <i>Creet</i></span>
						<br/>
						<span>And <i>Ida</i> known, thence on the Snowy top</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of cold <i>Olympus</i> rul’d the middle Air</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Thir highest Heav’n; or on the <i>Delphian</i> Cliff,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Or in <i>Dodona</i>, and through all the bounds</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of <i>Doric</i> Land; or who with <i>Saturn</i> old</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Fled over <i>Adria</i> to th’ <i>Hesperian</i> Fields,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And ore the <i>Celtic</i> roam’d the utmost Isles.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>All these and more came flocking; but with looks</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Down cast and damp, yet such wherein appear’d</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Obscure som glimps of joy, to have found thir chief</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Not in despair, to have found themselves not lost</span>
						<br/>
						<span>In loss it self; which on his count’nance cast</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Like doubtful hue: but he his wonted pride</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Soon recollecting, with high words, that bore</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Semblance of worth not substance, gently rais’d</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Their fainted courage, and dispel’d their fears.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Then strait commands that at the warlike sound</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of Trumpets loud and Clarions be upreard</span>
						<br/>
						<span>His mighty Standard; that proud honour claim’d</span>
						<br/>
						<span><i>Azazel</i> as his right, a Cherube tall:</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Who forthwith from the glittering Staff unfurld</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Th’ Imperial Ensign, which full high advanc’t</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Shon like a Meteor streaming to the Wind</span>
						<br/>
						<span>With Gemms and Golden lustre rich imblaz’d,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Seraphic arms and Trophies: all the while</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Sonorous mettal blowing Martial sounds:</span>
						<br/>
						<span>At which the universal Host upsent</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A shout that tore Hells Concave, and beyond</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Frighted the Reign of <i>Chaos</i> and old Night.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>All in a moment through the gloom were seen</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Ten thousand Banners rise into the Air</span>
						<br/>
						<span>With Orient Colours waving: with them rose</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A Forrest huge of Spears: and thronging Helms</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Appear’d, and serried Shields in thick array</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of depth immeasurable: Anon they move</span>
						<br/>
						<span>In perfect <i>Phalanx</i> to the Dorian mood</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of Flutes and soft Recorders; such as rais’d</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To highth of noblest temper Hero’s old</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Arming to Battel, and in stead of rage</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Deliberate valour breath’d, firm and unmov’d</span>
						<br/>
						<span>With dread of death to flight or foul retreat,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Nor wanting power to mitigate and swage</span>
						<br/>
						<span>With solemn touches, troubl’d thoughts, and chase</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Anguish and doubt and fear and sorrow and pain</span>
						<br/>
						<span>From mortal or immortal minds.  Thus they</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Breathing united force with fixed thought</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Mov’d on in silence to soft Pipes that charm’d</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Thir painful steps o’re the burnt soyle; and now</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Advanc’t in view they stand, a horrid Front</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of dreadful length and dazling Arms, in guise</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of Warriers old with order’d Spear and Shield,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Awaiting what command thir mighty Chief</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Had to impose: He through the armed Files</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Darts his experienc’t eye, and soon traverse</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The whole Battalion views, thir order due,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Thir visages and stature as of Gods,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Thir number last he summs.  And now his heart</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Distends with pride, and hardning in his strength</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Glories: For never since created man,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Met such imbodied force, as nam’d with these</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Could merit more then that small infantry</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Warr’d on by Cranes: though all the Giant brood</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of <i>Phlegra</i> with th’ Heroic Race were joyn’d</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That fought at <i>Theb’s</i> and <i>Ilium</i>, on each side</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Mixt with auxiliar Gods; and what resounds</span>
						<br/>
						<span>In Fable or <i>Romance</i> of <i>Uthers</i> Son</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Begirt with <i>British</i> and <i>Armoric</i> Knights;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And all who since, Baptiz’d or Infidel</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Jousted in <i>Aspramont</i> or <i>Montalban</i>,</span>
						<br/>
						<span><i>Damasco</i>, or <i>Marocco</i>, or <i>Trebisond</i>,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Or whom <i>Biserta</i> sent from <i>Afric</i> shore</span>
						<br/>
						<span>When <i>Charlemain</i> with all his Peerage fell</span>
						<br/>
						<span>By <i>Fontarabbia</i>.  Thus far these beyond</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Compare of mortal prowess, yet observ’d</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Thir dread Commander: he above the rest</span>
						<br/>
						<span>In shape and gesture proudly eminent</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Stood like a Towr; his form had yet not lost</span>
						<br/>
						<span>All her Original brightness, nor appear’d</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Less then Arch Angel ruind, and th’ excess</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of Glory obscur’d: As when the Sun new ris’n</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Looks through the Horizontal misty Air</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Shorn of his Beams, or from behind the Moon</span>
						<br/>
						<span>In dim Eclips disastrous twilight sheds</span>
						<br/>
						<span>On half the Nations, and with fear of change</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Perplexes Monarchs.  Dark’n’d so, yet shon</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Above them all th’ Arch Angel: but his face</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Deep scars of Thunder had intrencht, and care</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Sat on his faded cheek, but under Browes</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of dauntless courage, and considerate Pride</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Waiting revenge: cruel his eye, but cast</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Signs of remorse and passion to behold</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The fellows of his crime, the followers rather</span>
						<br/>
						<span>(Far other once beheld in bliss) condemn’d</span>
						<br/>
						<span>For ever now to have their lot in pain,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Millions of Spirits for his fault amerc’t</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of Heav’n, and from Eternal Splendors flung</span>
						<br/>
						<span>For his revolt, yet faithfull how they stood,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Thir Glory witherd.  As when Heavens Fire</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Hath scath’d the Forrest Oaks, or Mountain Pines,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>With singed top their stately growth though bare</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Stands on the blasted Heath.  He now prepar’d</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To speak; whereat their doubl’d Ranks they bend</span>
						<br/>
						<span>From Wing to Wing, and half enclose him round</span>
						<br/>
						<span>With all his Peers: attention held them mute.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Thrice he assayd, and thrice in spite of scorn,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Tears such as Angels weep, burst forth: at last</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Words interwove with sighs found out their way.</span>

						<span>O Myriads of immortal Spirits, O Powers</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Matchless, but with th’ Almighty, and that strife</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Was not inglorious, though th’ event was dire,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>As this place testifies, and this dire change</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Hateful to utter: but what power of mind</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Foreseeing or presaging, from the Depth</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of knowledge past or present, could have fear’d,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>How such united force of Gods, how such</span>
						<br/>
						<span>As stood like these, could ever know repulse?</span>
						<br/>
						<span>For who can yet beleeve, though after loss,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That all these puissant Legions, whose exile</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Hath emptied Heav’n, shall faile to re-ascend</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Self-rais’d, and repossess their native seat.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>For me, be witness all the Host of Heav’n,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>If counsels different, or danger shun’d</span>
						<br/>
						<span>By me, have lost our hopes.  But he who reigns</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Monarch in Heav’n, till then as one secure</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Sat on his Throne, upheld by old repute,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Consent or custome, and his Regal State</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Put forth at full, but still his strength conceal’d,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Which tempted our attempt, and wrought our fall.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Henceforth his might we know, and know our own</span>
						<br/>
						<span>So as not either to provoke, or dread</span>
						<br/>
						<span>New warr, provok’t; our better part remains</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To work in close design, by fraud or guile</span>
						<br/>
						<span>What force effected not: that he no less</span>
						<br/>
						<span>At length from us may find, who overcomes</span>
						<br/>
						<span>By force, hath overcome but half his foe.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Space may produce new Worlds; whereof so rife</span>
						<br/>
						<span>There went a fame in Heav’n that he ere long</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Intended to create, and therein plant</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A generation, whom his choice regard</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Should favour equal to the Sons of Heaven:</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Thither, if but to prie, shall be perhaps</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Our first eruption, thither or elsewhere:</span>
						<br/>
						<span>For this Infernal Pit shall never hold</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Caelestial Spirits in Bondage, nor th’ Abysse</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Long under darkness cover.  But these thoughts</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Full Counsel must mature: Peace is despaird,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>For who can think Submission?  Warr then, Warr</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Open or understood must be resolv’d.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>He spake: and to confirm his words, out-flew</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Millions of flaming swords, drawn from the thighs</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of mighty Cherubim; the sudden blaze</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Far round illumin’d hell: highly they rag’d</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Against the Highest, and fierce with grasped arm’s</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Clash’d on their sounding shields the din of war,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Hurling defiance toward the vault of Heav’n.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>There stood a Hill not far whose griesly top</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Belch’d fire and rowling smoak; the rest entire</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Shon with a glossie scurff, undoubted sign</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That in his womb was hid metallic Ore,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The work of Sulphur.  Thither wing’d with speed</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A numerous Brigad hasten’d.  As when bands</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of Pioners with Spade and Pickaxe arm’d</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Forerun the Royal Camp, to trench a Field,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Or cast a Rampart.  <i>Mammon</i> led them on,</span>
						<br/>
						<span><i>Mammon</i>, the least erected Spirit that fell</span>
						<br/>
						<span>From heav’n, for ev’n in heav’n his looks &amp; thoughts</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Were always downward bent, admiring more</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The riches of Heav’ns pavement, trod’n Gold,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Then aught divine or holy else enjoy’d</span>
						<br/>
						<span>In vision beatific: by him first</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Men also, and by his suggestion taught,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Ransack’d the Center, and with impious hands</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Rifl’d the bowels of thir mother Earth</span>
						<br/>
						<span>For Treasures better hid.  Soon had his crew</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Op’nd into the Hill a spacious wound</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And dig’d out ribs of Gold.  Let none admire</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That riches grow in Hell; that soyle may best</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Deserve the pretious bane.  And here let those</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Who boast in mortal things, and wondring tell</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of <i>Babel</i>, and the works of <i>Memphian</i> Kings,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Learn how thir greatest Monuments of Fame,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And Strength and Art are easily outdone</span>
						<br/>
						<span>By Spirits reprobate, and in an hour</span>
						<br/>
						<span>What in an age they with incessant toyle</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And hands innumerable scarce perform</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Nigh on the Plain in many cells prepar’d,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That underneath had veins of liquid fire</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Sluc’d from the Lake, a second multitude</span>
						<br/>
						<span>With wondrous Art founded the massie Ore,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Severing each kinde, and scum’d the Bullion dross:</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A third as soon had form’d within the ground</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A various mould, and from the boyling cells</span>
						<br/>
						<span>By strange conveyance fill’d each hollow nook,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>As in an Organ from one blast of wind</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To many a row of Pipes the sound-board breaths.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Anon out of the earth a Fabrick huge</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Rose like an Exhalation, with the sound</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of Dulcet Symphonies and voices sweet,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Built like a Temple, where <i>Pilasters</i> round</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Were set, and Doric pillars overlaid</span>
						<br/>
						<span>With Golden Architrave; nor did there want</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Cornice or Freeze, with bossy Sculptures grav’n,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The Roof was fretted Gold.  Not <i>Babilon</i>,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Nor great <i>Alcairo</i> such magnificence</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Equal’d in all thir glories, to inshrine</span>
						<br/>
						<span><i>Belus</i> or <i>Serapis</i> thir Gods, or seat</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Thir Kings, when <i>Aegypt</i> with <i>Assyria</i> strove</span>
						<br/>
						<span>In wealth and luxurie.  Th’ ascending pile</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Stood fixt her stately highth, and strait the dores</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Op’ning thir brazen foulds discover wide</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Within, her ample spaces, o’re the smooth</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And level pavement: from the arched roof</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Pendant by suttle Magic many a row</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of Starry Lamps and blazing Cressets fed</span>
						<br/>
						<span>With Naphtha and <i>Asphaltus</i> yeilded light</span>
						<br/>
						<span>As from a sky.  The hasty multitude</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Admiring enter’d, and the work some praise</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And some the Architect: his hand was known</span>
						<br/>
						<span>In Heav’n by many a Towred structure high,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Where Scepter’d Angels held thir residence,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And sat as Princes, whom the supreme King</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Exalted to such power, and gave to rule,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Each in his Herarchie, the Orders bright.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Nor was his name unheard or unador’d</span>
						<br/>
						<span>In ancient Greece; and in <i>Ausonian</i> land</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Men call’d him <i>Mulciber</i>; and how he fell</span>
						<br/>
						<span>From Heav’n, they fabl’d, thrown by angry <i>Jove</i></span>
						<br/>
						<span>Sheer o’re the Chrystal Battlements: from Morn</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To Noon he fell, from Noon to dewy Eve,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A Summers day; and with the setting Sun</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Dropt from the Zenith like a falling Star,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>On <i>Lemnos</i> th’ <i>Aegaean</i> Ile: thus they relate,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Erring; for he with this rebellious rout</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Fell long before; nor aught avail’d him now</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To have built in Heav’n high Towrs; nor did he scape</span>
						<br/>
						<span>By all his Engins, but was headlong sent</span>
						<br/>
						<span>With his industrious crew to build in hell.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Mean while the winged Haralds by command</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of Sovran power, with awful Ceremony</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And Trumpets sound throughout the Host proclaim</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A solemn Councel forthwith to be held</span>
						<br/>
						<span>At <i>Pandaemonium</i>, the high Capital</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of Satan and his Peers: thir summons call’d</span>
						<br/>
						<span>From every and Band squared Regiment</span>
						<br/>
						<span>By place or choice the worthiest; they anon</span>
						<br/>
						<span>With hundreds and with thousands trooping came</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Attended: all access was throng’d, the Gates</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And Porches wide, but chief the spacious Hall</span>
						<br/>
						<span>(Though like a cover’d field, where Champions bold</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Wont ride in arm’d, and at the Soldans chair</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Defi’d the best of Panim chivalry</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To mortal combat or carreer with Lance)</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Thick swarm’d, both on the ground and in the air,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Brusht with the hiss of russling wings.  As Bees</span>
						<br/>
						<span>In spring time, when the Sun with Taurus rides,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Poure forth thir populous youth about the Hive</span>
						<br/>
						<span>In clusters; they among fresh dews and flowers</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Flie to and fro, or on the smoothed Plank,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The suburb of thir Straw-built Cittadel,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>New rub’d with Baume, expatiate and confer</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Thir State affairs.  So thick the aerie crowd</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Swarm’d and were straitn’d; till the Signal giv’n,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Behold a wonder! they but now who seemd</span>
						<br/>
						<span>In bigness to surpass Earths Giant Sons</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Now less then smallest Dwarfs, in narrow room</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Throng numberless, like that Pigmean Race</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Beyond the <i>Indian</i> Mount, or Faerie Elves,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Whose midnight Revels, by a Forrest side</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Or Fountain fome belated Peasant sees,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Or dreams he sees, while over head the Moon</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Sits Arbitress, and neerer to the Earth</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Wheels her pale course, they on thir mirth &amp; dance</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Intent, with jocond Music charm his ear;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>At once with joy and fear his heart rebounds.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Thus incorporeal Spirits to smallest forms</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Reduc’d thir shapes immense, and were at large,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Though without number still amidst the Hall</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of that infernal Court.  But far within</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And in thir own dimensions like themselves</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The great Seraphic Lords and Cherubim</span>
						<br/>
						<span>In close recess and secret conclave sat</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A thousand Demy-Gods on golden seat’s,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Frequent and full.  After short silence then</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And summons read, the great consult began.</span>
