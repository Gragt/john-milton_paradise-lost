<p class="pfirst">
O For that warning voice, which he who saw<br/>
Th’ <i>Apocalyps</i>, heard cry in Heaven aloud,<br/>
Then when the Dragon, put to second rout,<br/>
Came furious down to be reveng’d on men,<br/>
<i>Wo to the Inhabitants on Earth!</i> that now,<br/>
While time was, our first Parents had bin warnd<br/>
The coming of thir secret foe, and scap’d<br/>
Haply so scap’d his mortal snare; for now<br/>
<i>Satan</i>, now first inflam’d with rage, came down,<br/>
The Tempter ere th’ Accuser of man-kind,<br/>
To wreck on innocent frail man his loss<br/>
Of that first Battel, and his flight to Hell:<br/>
Yet not rejoycing in his speed, though bold,<br/>
Far off and fearless, nor with cause to boast,<br/>
Begins his dire attempt, which nigh the birth<br/>
Now rowling, boiles in his tumultuous brest,<br/>
And like a devillish Engine back recoiles<br/>
Upon himself; horror and doubt distract<br/>
His troubl’d thoughts, and from the bottom stirr<br/>
The Hell within him, for within him Hell<br/>
He brings, and round about him, nor from Hell<br/>
One step no more then from himself can fly<br/>
By change of place: Now conscience wakes despair<br/>
That slumberd, wakes the bitter memorie<br/>
Of what he was, what is, and what must be<br/>
Worse; of worse deeds worse sufferings must ensue.<br/>
Sometimes towards <i>Eden</i> which now in his view<br/>
Lay pleasant, his grievd look he fixes sad,<br/>
Sometimes towards Heav’n and the full-blazing Sun,<br/>
Which now sat high in his Meridian Towre:<br/>
Then much revolving, thus in sighs began.<br/>
</p>
<p class="poem">
O thou that with surpassing Glory crownd,<br/>
Look’st from thy sole Dominion like the God<br/>
Of this new World; at whose sight all the Starrs<br/>
Hide thir diminisht heads; to thee I call,<br/>
But with no friendly voice, and add thy name<br/>
O Sun, to tell thee how I hate thy beams<br/>
That bring to my remembrance from what state<br/>
I fell, how glorious once above thy Spheare;<br/>
Till Pride and worse Ambition threw me down<br/>
Warring in Heav’n against Heav’ns matchless King:<br/>
Ah wherefore! he deservd no such return<br/>
From me, whom he created what I was<br/>
In that bright eminence, and with his good<br/>
Upbraided none; nor was his service hard.<br/>
What could be less then to afford him praise,<br/>
The easiest recompence, and pay him thanks,<br/>
How due! yet all his good prov’d ill in me,<br/>
And wrought but malice; lifted up so high<br/>
I sdeind subjection, and thought one step higher<br/>
Would set me highest, and in a moment quit<br/>
The debt immense of endless gratitude,<br/>
So burthensome, still paying, still to ow;<br/>
Forgetful what from him I still receivd,<br/>
And understood not that a grateful mind<br/>
By owing owes not, but still pays, at once<br/>
Indebted and dischargd; what burden then?<br/>
O had his powerful Destiny ordaind<br/>
Me some inferiour Angel, I had stood<br/>
Then happie; no unbounded hope had rais’d<br/>
Ambition.  Yet why not? som other Power<br/>
As great might have aspir’d, and me though mean<br/>
Drawn to his part; but other Powers as great<br/>
Fell not, but stand unshak’n, from within<br/>
Or from without, to all temptations arm’d.<br/>
Hadst thou the same free Will and Power to stand?<br/>
Thou hadst: whom hast thou then or what to accuse,<br/>
But Heav’ns free Love dealt equally to all?<br/>
Be then his Love accurst, since love or hate,<br/>
To me alike, it deals eternal woe.<br/>
Nay curs’d be thou; since against his thy will<br/>
Chose freely what it now so justly rues.<br/>
Me miserable! which way shall I flie<br/>
Infinite wrauth, and infinite despaire?<br/>
Which way I flie is Hell; my self am Hell;<br/>
And in the lowest deep a lower deep<br/>
Still threatning to devour me opens wide,<br/>
To which the Hell I suffer seems a Heav’n.<br/>
O then at last relent: is there no place<br/>
Left for Repentance, none for Pardon left?<br/>
None left but by submission; and that word<br/>
<i>Disdain</i> forbids me, and my dread of shame<br/>
Among the spirits beneath, whom I seduc’d<br/>
With other promises and other vaunts<br/>
Then to submit, boasting I could subdue<br/>
Th’ Omnipotent.  Ay me, they little know<br/>
How dearly I abide that boast so vaine,<br/>
Under what torments inwardly I groane;<br/>
While they adore me on the Throne of Hell,<br/>
With Diadem and Scepter high advanc’d<br/>
The lower still I fall, onely Supream<br/>
In miserie; such joy Ambition findes.<br/>
But say I could repent and could obtaine<br/>
By Act of Grace my former state; how soon<br/>
Would highth recal high thoughts, how soon unsay<br/>
What feign’d submission swore: ease would recant<br/>
Vows made in pain, as violent and void.<br/>
For never can true reconcilement grow<br/>
Where wounds of deadly hate have peirc’d so deep:<br/>
Which would but lead me to a worse relapse<br/>
And heavier fall: so should I purchase deare<br/>
Short intermission bought with double smart.<br/>
This knows my punisher; therefore as farr<br/>
From granting hee, as I from begging peace:<br/>
All hope excluded thus, behold in stead<br/>
Of us out-cast, exil’d, his new delight,<br/>
Mankind created, and for him this World.<br/>
So farwel Hope, and with Hope farwel Fear,<br/>
Farwel Remorse: all Good to me is lost;<br/>
Evil be thou my Good; by thee at least<br/>
Divided Empire with Heav’ns King I hold<br/>
By thee, and more then half perhaps will reigne;<br/>
As Man ere long, and this new World shall know.<br/>
</p>
<p class="poem">
Thus while he spake, each passion dimm’d his face<br/>
Thrice chang’d with pale, ire, envie and despair,<br/>
Which marrd his borrow’d visage, and betraid<br/>
Him counterfet, if any eye beheld.<br/>
For heav’nly mindes from such distempers foule<br/>
Are ever cleer.  Whereof hee soon aware,<br/>
Each perturbation smooth’d with outward calme,<br/>
Artificer of fraud; and was the first<br/>
That practisd falshood under saintly shew,<br/>
Deep malice to conceale, couch’t with revenge:<br/>
Yet not anough had practisd to deceive<br/>
<i>Uriel</i> once warnd; whose eye pursu’d him down<br/>
The way he went, and on th’ <i>Assyrian</i> mount<br/>
Saw him disfigur’d, more then could befall<br/>
Spirit of happie sort: his gestures fierce<br/>
He markd and mad demeanour, then alone,<br/>
As he suppos’d, all unobserv’d, unseen.<br/>
So on he fares, and to the border comes<br/>
Of <i>Eden</i>, where delicious Paradise,<br/>
Now nearer, Crowns with her enclosure green,<br/>
As with a rural mound the champain head<br/>
Of a steep wilderness, whose hairie sides<br/>
With thicket overgrown, grottesque and wilde,<br/>
Access deni’d; and over head up grew<br/>
Insuperable highth of loftiest shade,<br/>
Cedar, and Pine, and Firr, and branching Palm,<br/>
A Silvan Scene, and as the ranks ascend<br/>
Shade above shade, a woodie Theatre<br/>
Of stateliest view.  Yet higher then thir tops<br/>
The verdurous wall of Paradise up sprung:<br/>
Which to our general Sire gave prospect large<br/>
Into his neather Empire neighbouring round.<br/>
And higher then that Wall a circling row<br/>
Of goodliest Trees loaden with fairest Fruit,<br/>
Blossoms and Fruits at once of golden hue<br/>
Appeerd, with gay enameld colours mixt:<br/>
On which the Sun more glad impress’d his beams<br/>
Then in fair Evening Cloud, or humid Bow,<br/>
When God hath showrd the earth; so lovely seemd<br/>
That Lantskip: And of pure now purer aire<br/>
Meets his approach, and to the heart inspires<br/>
Vernal delight and joy, able to drive<br/>
All sadness but despair: now gentle gales<br/>
Fanning thir odoriferous wings dispense<br/>
Native perfumes, and whisper whence they stole<br/>
Those balmie spoiles.  As when to them who saile<br/>
Beyond the <i>Cape of Hope</i>, and now are past<br/>
<i>Mozambic</i>, off at Sea North-East windes blow<br/>
<i>Sabean</i> Odours from the spicie shoare<br/>
Of <i>Arabie</i> the blest, with such delay<br/>
Well pleas’d they slack thir course, and many a League<br/>
Cheard with the grateful smell old Ocean smiles.<br/>
So entertaind those odorous sweets the Fiend<br/>
Who came thir bane, though with them better pleas’d<br/>
Then <i>Asmodeus</i> with the fishie fume,<br/>
That drove him, though enamourd, from the Spouse<br/>
Of <i>Tobits</i> Son, and with a vengeance sent<br/>
From <i>Media</i> post to <i>Aegypt</i>, there fast bound.<br/>
</p>
<p class="poem">
Now to th’ ascent of that steep savage Hill<br/>
<i>Satan</i> had journied on, pensive and slow;<br/>
But further way found none, so thick entwin’d,<br/>
As one continu’d brake, the undergrowth<br/>
Of shrubs and tangling bushes had perplext<br/>
All path of Man or Beast that past that way:<br/>
One Gate there onely was, and that look’d East<br/>
On th’ other side: which when th’ arch-fellon saw<br/>
Due entrance he disdaind, and in contempt,<br/>
At one slight bound high overleap’d all bound<br/>
Of Hill or highest Wall, and sheer within<br/>
Lights on his feet.  As when a prowling Wolfe,<br/>
Whom hunger drives to seek new haunt for prey,<br/>
Watching where Shepherds pen thir Flocks at eeve<br/>
In hurdl’d Cotes amid the field secure,<br/>
Leaps o’re the fence with ease into the Fould:<br/>
Or as a Thief bent to unhoord the cash<br/>
Of some rich Burgher, whose substantial dores,<br/>
Cross-barrd and bolted fast, fear no assault,<br/>
In at the window climbes, or o’re the tiles;<br/>
So clomb this first grand Thief into Gods Fould:<br/>
So since into his Church lewd Hirelings climbe.<br/>
Thence up he flew, and on the Tree of Life,<br/>
The middle Tree and highest there that grew,<br/>
Sat like a Cormorant; yet not true Life<br/>
Thereby regaind, but sat devising Death<br/>
To them who liv’d; nor on the vertue thought<br/>
Of that life-giving Plant, but only us’d<br/>
For prospect, what well us’d had bin the pledge<br/>
Of immortalitie.  So little knows<br/>
Any, but God alone, to value right<br/>
The good before him, but perverts best things<br/>
To worst abuse, or to thir meanest use.<br/>
Beneath him with new wonder now he views<br/>
To all delight of human sense expos’d<br/>
In narrow room Natures whole wealth, yea more,<br/>
A Heaven on Earth, for blissful Paradise<br/>
Of God the Garden was, by him in the East<br/>
Of <i>Eden</i> planted; <i>Eden</i> stretchd her Line<br/>
From <i>Auran</i> Eastward to the Royal Towrs<br/>
Of great <i>Seleucia</i>, built by <i>Grecian</i> Kings,<br/>
Or where the Sons of <i>Eden</i> long before<br/>
Dwelt in <i>Telassar:</i> in this pleasant soile<br/>
His farr more pleasant Garden God ordaind;<br/>
Out of the fertil ground he caus’d to grow<br/>
All Trees of noblest kind for sight, smell, taste;<br/>
And all amid them stood the Tree of Life,<br/>
High eminent, blooming Ambrosial Fruit<br/>
Of vegetable Gold; and next to Life<br/>
Our Death the Tree of Knowledge grew fast by,<br/>
Knowledge of Good bought dear by knowing ill.<br/>
Southward through <i>Eden</i> went a River large,<br/>
Nor chang’d his course, but through the shaggie hill<br/>
Pass’d underneath ingulft, for God had thrown<br/>
That Mountain as his Garden mould high rais’d<br/>
Upon the rapid current, which through veins<br/>
Of porous Earth with kindly thirst up drawn,<br/>
Rose a fresh Fountain, and with many a rill<br/>
Waterd the Garden; thence united fell<br/>
Down the steep glade, and met the neather Flood,<br/>
Which from his darksom passage now appeers,<br/>
And now divided into four main Streams,<br/>
Runs divers, wandring many a famous Realme<br/>
And Country whereof here needs no account,<br/>
But rather to tell how, if Art could tell,<br/>
How from that Saphire Fount the crisped Brooks,<br/>
Rowling on Orient Pearl and sands of Gold,<br/>
With mazie error under pendant shades<br/>
Ran Nectar, visiting each plant, and fed<br/>
Flours worthy of Paradise which not nice Art<br/>
In Beds and curious Knots, but Nature boon<br/>
Powrd forth profuse on Hill and Dale and Plaine,<br/>
Both where the morning Sun first warmly smote<br/>
The open field, and where the unpierc’t shade<br/>
Imbround the noontide Bowrs: Thus was this place,<br/>
A happy rural seat of various view;<br/>
Groves whose rich Trees wept odorous Gumms and Balme,<br/>
Others whose fruit burnisht with Golden Rinde<br/>
Hung amiable, <i>Hesperian</i> Fables true,<br/>
If true, here onely, and of delicious taste:<br/>
Betwixt them Lawns, or level Downs, and Flocks<br/>
Grasing the tender herb, were interpos’d,<br/>
Or palmie hilloc, or the flourie lap<br/>
Of som irriguous Valley spread her store,<br/>
Flours of all hue, and without Thorn the Rose:<br/>
Another side, umbrageous Grots and Caves<br/>
Of coole recess, o’re which the mantling Vine<br/>
Layes forth her purple Grape, and gently creeps<br/>
Luxuriant; mean while murmuring waters fall<br/>
Down the slope hills, disperst, or in a Lake,<br/>
That to the fringed Bank with Myrtle crownd,<br/>
Her chrystall mirror holds, unite thir streams.<br/>
The Birds thir quire apply; aires, vernal aires,<br/>
Breathing the smell of field and grove, attune<br/>
The trembling leaves, while Universal <i>Pan</i><br/>
Knit with the <i>Graces</i> and the <i>Hours</i> in dance<br/>
Led on th’ Eternal Spring.  Not that faire field<br/>
Of <i>Enna</i>, where <i>Proserpin</i> gathring flours<br/>
Her self a fairer Floure by gloomie <i>Dis</i><br/>
Was gatherd, which cost <i>Ceres</i> all that pain<br/>
To seek her through the world; nor that sweet Grove<br/>
Of <i>Daphne</i> by <i>Orontes</i>, and th’ inspir’d<br/>
<i>Castalian</i> Spring might with this Paradise<br/>
Of <i>Eden</i> strive; nor that <i>Nyseian</i> Ile<br/>
Girt with the River <i>Triton</i>, where old <i>Cham</i>,<br/>
Whom Gentiles <i>Ammon</i> call and <i>Libyan Jove</i>,<br/>
Hid <i>Amalthea</i> and her Florid Son<br/>
Young <i>Bacchus</i> from his Stepdame <i>Rhea’s</i> eye;<br/>
Nor where <i>Abassin</i> Kings thir issue Guard,<br/>
Mount <i>Amara</i>, though this by som suppos’d<br/>
True Paradise under the <i>Ethiop</i> Line<br/>
By <i>Nilus</i> head, enclos’d with shining Rock,<br/>
A whole dayes journey high, but wide remote<br/>
From this <i>Assyrian</i> Garden, where the Fiend<br/>
Saw undelighted all delight, all kind<br/>
Of living Creatures new to sight and strange:<br/>
Two of far nobler shape erect and tall,<br/>
Godlike erect, with native Honour clad<br/>
In naked Majestie seemd Lords of all,<br/>
And worthie seemd, for in thir looks Divine<br/>
The image of thir glorious Maker shon,<br/>
Truth, Wisdome, Sanctitude severe and pure,<br/>
Severe, but in true filial freedom plac’t;<br/>
Whence true autoritie in men; though both<br/>
Not equal, as thir sex not equal seemd;<br/>
For contemplation hee and valour formd,<br/>
For softness shee and sweet attractive Grace,<br/>
Hee for God only, shee for God in him:<br/>
His fair large Front and Eye sublime declar’d<br/>
Absolute rule; and Hyacinthin Locks<br/>
Round from his parted forelock manly hung<br/>
Clustring, but not beneath his shoulders broad:<br/>
Shee as a vail down to the slender waste<br/>
Her unadorned golden tresses wore<br/>
Dissheveld, but in wanton ringlets wav’d<br/>
As the Vine curles her tendrils, which impli’d<br/>
Subjection, but requir’d with gentle sway,<br/>
And by her yeilded, by him best receivd,<br/>
Yeilded with coy submission, modest pride,<br/>
And sweet reluctant amorous delay.<br/>
Nor those mysterious parts were then conceald,<br/>
Then was not guiltie shame, dishonest shame<br/>
Of natures works, honor dishonorable,<br/>
Sin-bred, how have ye troubl’d all mankind<br/>
With shews instead, meer shews of seeming pure,<br/>
And banisht from mans life his happiest life,<br/>
Simplicitie and spotless innocence.<br/>
So passd they naked on, nor shund the sight<br/>
Of God or Angel, for they thought no ill:<br/>
So hand in hand they passd, the lovliest pair<br/>
That ever since in loves imbraces met,<br/>
<i>Adam</i> the goodliest man of men since borne<br/>
His Sons, the fairest of her Daughters <i>Eve</i>.<br/>
Under a tuft of shade that on a green<br/>
Stood whispering soft, by a fresh Fountain side<br/>
They sat them down, and after no more toil<br/>
Of thir sweet Gardning labour then suffic’d<br/>
To recommend coole <i>Zephyr</i>, and made ease<br/>
More easie, wholsom thirst and appetite<br/>
More grateful, to thir Supper Fruits they fell,<br/>
Nectarine Fruits which the compliant boughes<br/>
Yeilded them, side-long as they sat recline<br/>
On the soft downie Bank damaskt with flours:<br/>
The savourie pulp they chew, and in the rinde<br/>
Still as they thirsted scoop the brimming stream;<br/>
Nor gentle purpose, nor endearing smiles<br/>
Wanted, nor youthful dalliance as beseems<br/>
Fair couple, linkt in happie nuptial League,<br/>
Alone as they.  About them frisking playd<br/>
All Beasts of th’ Earth, since wilde, and of all chase<br/>
In Wood or Wilderness, Forrest or Den;<br/>
Sporting the Lion rampd, and in his paw<br/>
Dandl’d the Kid; Bears, Tygers, Ounces, Pards<br/>
Gambold before them, th’ unwieldy Elephant<br/>
To make them mirth us’d all his might, &amp; wreathd<br/>
His Lithe Proboscis; close the Serpent sly<br/>
Insinuating, wove with Gordian twine<br/>
His breaded train, and of his fatal guile<br/>
Gave proof unheeded; others on the grass<br/>
Coucht, and now fild with pasture gazing sat,<br/>
Or Bedward ruminating: for the Sun<br/>
Declin’d was hasting now with prone carreer<br/>
To th’ Ocean Iles, and in th’ ascending Scale<br/>
Of Heav’n the Starrs that usher Evening rose:<br/>
When <i>Satan</i> still in gaze, as first he stood,<br/>
Scarce thus at length faild speech recoverd sad.<br/>
</p>
<p class="poem">
O Hell! what doe mine eyes with grief behold,<br/>
Into our room of bliss thus high advanc’t<br/>
Creatures of other mould, earth-born perhaps,<br/>
Not Spirits, yet to heav’nly Spirits bright<br/>
Little inferior; whom my thoughts pursue<br/>
With wonder, and could love, so lively shines<br/>
In them Divine resemblance, and such grace<br/>
The hand that formd them on thir shape hath pourd.<br/>
Ah gentle pair, yee little think how nigh<br/>
Your change approaches, when all these delights<br/>
Will vanish and deliver ye to woe,<br/>
More woe, the more your taste is now of joy;<br/>
Happie, but for so happie ill secur’d<br/>
Long to continue, and this high seat your Heav’n<br/>
Ill fenc’t for Heav’n to keep out such a foe<br/>
As now is enterd; yet no purpos’d foe<br/>
To you whom I could pittie thus forlorne<br/>
Though I unpittied: League with you I seek,<br/>
And mutual amitie so streight, so close,<br/>
That I with you must dwell, or you with me<br/>
Henceforth; my dwelling haply may not please<br/>
Like this fair Paradise, your sense, yet such<br/>
Accept your Makers work; he gave it me,<br/>
Which I as freely give; Hell shall unfould,<br/>
To entertain you two, her widest Gates,<br/>
And send forth all her Kings; there will be room,<br/>
Not like these narrow limits, to receive<br/>
Your numerous ofspring; if no better place,<br/>
Thank him who puts me loath to this revenge<br/>
On you who wrong me not for him who wrongd.<br/>
And should I at your harmless innocence<br/>
Melt, as I doe, yet public reason just,<br/>
Honour and Empire with revenge enlarg’d,<br/>
By conquering this new World, compels me now<br/>
To do what else though damnd I should abhorre.<br/>
</p>
<p class="poem">
So spake the Fiend, and with necessitie,<br/>
The Tyrants plea, excus’d his devilish deeds.<br/>
Then from his loftie stand on that high Tree<br/>
Down he alights among the sportful Herd<br/>
Of those fourfooted kindes, himself now one,<br/>
Now other, as thir shape servd best his end<br/>
Neerer to view his prey, and unespi’d<br/>
To mark what of thir state he more might learn<br/>
By word or action markt: about them round<br/>
A Lion now he stalkes with fierie glare,<br/>
Then as a Tiger, who by chance hath spi’d<br/>
In some Purlieu two gentle Fawnes at play,<br/>
Strait couches close, then rising changes oft<br/>
His couchant watch, as one who chose his ground<br/>
Whence rushing he might surest seise them both<br/>
Grip’t in each paw: when <i>Adam</i> first of men<br/>
To first of women <i>Eve</i> thus moving speech,<br/>
Turnd him all eare to heare new utterance flow.<br/>

<p class="poem">
Sole partner and sole part of all these joyes,<br/>
Dearer thy self then all; needs must the Power<br/>
That made us, and for us this ample World<br/>
Be infinitly good, and of his good<br/>
As liberal and free as infinite,<br/>
That rais’d us from the dust and plac’t us here<br/>
In all this happiness, who at his hand<br/>
Have nothing merited, nor can performe<br/>
Aught whereof hee hath need, hee who requires<br/>
From us no other service then to keep<br/>
This one, this easie charge, of all the Trees<br/>
In Paradise that beare delicious fruit<br/>
So various, not to taste that onely Tree<br/>
Of knowledge, planted by the Tree of Life,<br/>
So neer grows Death to Life, what ere Death is,<br/>
Som dreadful thing no doubt; for well thou knowst<br/>
God hath pronounc’t it death to taste that Tree,<br/>
The only sign of our obedience left<br/>
Among so many signes of power and rule<br/>
Conferrd upon us, and Dominion giv’n<br/>
Over all other Creatures that possesse<br/>
Earth, Aire, and Sea.  Then let us not think hard<br/>
One easie prohibition, who enjoy<br/>
Free leave so large to all things else, and choice<br/>
Unlimited of manifold delights:<br/>
But let us ever praise him, and extoll<br/>
His bountie, following our delightful task<br/>
To prune these growing Plants, &amp; tend these Flours,<br/>
Which were it toilsom, yet with thee were sweet.<br/>

<p class="poem">
To whom thus Eve repli’d.  O thou for whom<br/>
And from whom I was formd flesh of thy flesh,<br/>
And without whom am to no end, my Guide<br/>
And Head, what thou hast said is just and right.<br/>
For wee to him indeed all praises owe,<br/>
And daily thanks, I chiefly who enjoy<br/>
So farr the happier Lot, enjoying thee<br/>
Preeminent by so much odds, while thou<br/>
Like consort to thy self canst no where find.<br/>
That day I oft remember, when from sleep<br/>
I first awak’t, and found my self repos’d<br/>
Under a shade on flours, much wondring where<br/>
And what I was, whence thither brought, and how.<br/>
Not distant far from thence a murmuring sound<br/>
Of waters issu’d from a Cave and spread<br/>
Into a liquid Plain, then stood unmov’d<br/>
Pure as th’ expanse of Heav’n; I thither went<br/>
With unexperienc’t thought, and laid me downe<br/>
On the green bank, to look into the cleer<br/>
Smooth Lake, that to me seemd another Skie.<br/>
As I bent down to look, just opposite,<br/>
A Shape within the watry gleam appeerd<br/>
Bending to look on me, I started back,<br/>
It started back, but pleasd I soon returnd,<br/>
Pleas’d it returnd as soon with answering looks<br/>
Of sympathie and love, there I had fixt<br/>
Mine eyes till now, and pin’d with vain desire,<br/>
Had not a voice thus warnd me, What thou seest,<br/>
What there thou seest fair Creature is thy self,<br/>
With thee it came and goes: but follow me,<br/>
And I will bring thee where no shadow staies<br/>
Thy coming, and thy soft imbraces, hee<br/>
Whose image thou art, him thou shall enjoy<br/>
Inseparablie thine, to him shalt beare<br/>
Multitudes like thy self, and thence be call’d<br/>
Mother of human Race: what could I doe,<br/>
But follow strait, invisibly thus led?<br/>
Till I espi’d thee, fair indeed and tall,<br/>
Under a Platan, yet methought less faire,<br/>
Less winning soft, less amiablie milde,<br/>
Then that smooth watry image; back I turnd,<br/>
Thou following cryd’st aloud, Return fair <i>Eve</i>,<br/>
Whom fli’st thou? whom thou fli’st, of him thou art,<br/>
His flesh, his bone; to give thee being I lent<br/>
Out of my side to thee, neerest my heart<br/>
Substantial Life, to have thee by my side<br/>
Henceforth an individual solace dear;<br/>
Part of my Soul I seek thee, and thee claim<br/>
My other half: with that thy gentle hand<br/>
Seisd mine, I yeilded, and from that time see<br/>
How beauty is excelld by manly grace<br/>
And wisdom, which alone is truly fair.<br/>
</p>
<p class="poem">
So spake our general Mother, and with eyes<br/>
Of conjugal attraction unreprov’d,<br/>
And meek surrender, half imbracing leand<br/>
On our first Father, half her swelling Breast<br/>
Naked met his under the flowing Gold<br/>
Of her loose tresses hid: he in delight<br/>
Both of her Beauty and submissive Charms<br/>
Smil’d with superior Love, as <i>Jupiter</i><br/>
On <i>Juno</i> smiles, when he impregns the Clouds<br/>
That shed <i>May</i> Flowers; and press’d her Matron lip<br/>
With kisses pure: aside the Devil turnd<br/>
For envie, yet with jealous leer maligne<br/>
Ey’d them askance, and to himself thus plaind.<br/>

Sight hateful, sight tormenting! thus these two<br/>

Among our other torments not the least,<br/>
Still unfulfill’d with pain of longing pines;<br/>
Yet let me not forget what I have gain’d<br/>
From thir own mouths; all is not theirs it seems:<br/>
One fatal Tree there stands of Knowledge call’d,<br/>
Forbidden them to taste: Knowledge forbidd’n?<br/>
Suspicious, reasonless.  Why should thir Lord<br/>
Envie them that? can it be sin to know,<br/>
Can it be death? and do they onely stand<br/>
By Ignorance, is that thir happie state,<br/>
The proof of thir obedience and thir faith?<br/>
O fair foundation laid whereon to build<br/>
Thir ruine!  Hence I will excite thir minds<br/>
With more desire to know, and to reject<br/>
Envious commands, invented with designe<br/>
To keep them low whom knowledge might exalt<br/>
Equal with Gods; aspiring to be such,<br/>
They taste and die: what likelier can ensue?<br/>
But first with narrow search I must walk round<br/>
This Garden, and no corner leave unspi’d;<br/>
A chance but chance may lead where I may meet<br/>
Some wandring Spirit of Heav’n, by Fountain side,<br/>
Or in thick shade retir’d, from him to draw<br/>
What further would be learnt.  Live while ye may,<br/>
Yet happie pair; enjoy, till I return,<br/>
Short pleasures, for long woes are to succeed.<br/>

<p class="poem">
So saying, his proud step he scornful turn’d,<br/>
But with sly circumspection, and began<br/>
Through wood, through waste, o’re hil, o’re dale his roam.<br/>
Mean while in utmost Longitude, where Heav’n<br/>
With Earth and Ocean meets, the setting Sun<br/>
Slowly descended, and with right aspect<br/>
Against the eastern Gate of Paradise<br/>
Leveld his eevning Rayes: it was a Rock<br/>
Of Alablaster, pil’d up to the Clouds,<br/>
Conspicuous farr, winding with one ascent<br/>
Accessible from Earth, one entrance high;<br/>
The rest was craggie cliff, that overhung<br/>
Still as it rose, impossible to climbe.<br/>
Betwixt these rockie Pillars <i>Gabriel</i> sat<br/>
Chief of th’ Angelic Guards, awaiting night;<br/>
About him exercis’d Heroic Games<br/>
Th’ unarmed Youth of Heav’n, but nigh at hand<br/>
Celestial Armourie, Shields, Helmes, and Speares<br/>
Hung high with Diamond flaming, and with Gold.<br/>
Thither came <i>Uriel</i>, gliding through the Eeven<br/>
On a Sun beam, swift as a shooting Starr<br/>
In <i>Autumn</i> thwarts the night, when vapors fir’d<br/>
Impress the Air, and shews the Mariner<br/>
From what point of his Compass to beware<br/>
Impetuous winds: he thus began in haste.<br/>

A Spirit, zealous, as he seem’d, to know<br/>
More of th’ Almighties works, and chiefly Man<br/>
Gods latest Image: I describ’d his way<br/>
Bent all on speed, and markt his Aerie Gate;<br/>
But in the Mount that lies from <i>Eden</i> North,<br/>
Where he first lighted, soon discernd his looks<br/>
Alien from Heav’n, with passions foul obscur’d:<br/>
Mine eye pursu’d him still, but under shade<br/>
Lost sight of him; one of the banisht crew<br/>
I fear, hath ventur’d from the deep, to raise<br/>
New troubles; him thy care must be to find.<br/>

Well known from Heav’n; and since Meridian hour<br/>
No Creature thence: if Spirit of other sort,<br/>
So minded, have oreleapt these earthie bounds<br/>
On purpose, hard thou knowst it to exclude<br/>
Spiritual substance with corporeal barr.<br/>
But if within the circuit of these walks<br/>
In whatsoever shape he lurk, of whom<br/>

Incredible how swift, had thither rowl’d<br/>
Diurnal, or this less volubil Earth<br/>
By shorter flight to th’ East, had left him there<br/>
Arraying with reflected Purple and Gold<br/>
The Clouds that on his Western Throne attend:<br/>
Now came still Eevning on, and Twilight gray<br/>
Had in her sober Liverie all things clad;<br/>
Silence accompanied, for Beast and Bird,<br/>
They to thir grassie Couch, these to thir Nests<br/>
Were slunk, all but the wakeful Nightingale;<br/>
She all night long her amorous descant sung;<br/>
Silence was pleas’d: now glow’d the Firmament<br/>
With living Saphirs: <i>Hesperus</i> that led<br/>

Apparent Queen unvaild her peerless light,<br/>

Successive, and the timely dew of sleep<br/>
Now falling with soft slumbrous weight inclines<br/>
Our eye-lids; other Creatures all day long<br/>
Rove idle unimploid, and less need rest;<br/>

Appointed, which declares his Dignitie,<br/>
And the regard of Heav’n on all his waies;<br/>
While other Animals unactive range,<br/>
And of thir doings God takes no account.<br/>
Tomorrow ere fresh Morning streak the East<br/>
With first approach of light, we must be ris’n,<br/>
And at our pleasant labour, to reform<br/>
Yon flourie Arbors, yonder Allies green,<br/>
Our walks at noon, with branches overgrown,<br/>
That mock our scant manuring, and require<br/>
More hands then ours to lop thir wanton growth:<br/>
Those Blossoms also, and those dropping Gumms,<br/>

After soft showers; and sweet the coming on<br/>

Thus talking hand in hand alone they pass’d<br/>
On to thir blissful Bower; it was a place<br/>
Chos’n by the sovran Planter, when he fram’d<br/>
All things to mans delightful use; the roofe<br/>
Of thickest covert was inwoven shade<br/>
Laurel and Mirtle, and what higher grew<br/>
Of firm and fragrant leaf; on either side<br/>
<i>Acanthus</i>, and each odorous bushie shrub<br/>
Fenc’d up the verdant wall; each beauteous flour,<br/>
<i>Iris</i> all hues, Roses, and Gessamin<br/>
Rear’d high thir flourisht heads between, and wrought<br/>
Mosaic; underfoot the Violet,<br/>
Crocus, and Hyacinth with rich inlay<br/>
Broiderd the ground, more colour’d then with stone<br/>
Of costliest Emblem: other Creature here<br/>
Beast, Bird, Insect, or Worm durst enter none;<br/>
Such was thir awe of man.  In shadier Bower<br/>
More sacred and sequesterd, though but feignd,<br/>
<i>Pan</i> or <i>Silvanus</i> never slept, nor Nymph,<br/>
Nor <i>Faunus</i> haunted.  Here in close recess<br/>
With Flowers, Garlands, and sweet-smelling Herbs<br/>
Espoused <i>Eve</i> deckt first her Nuptial Bed,<br/>
And heav’nly Quires the Hymenaean sung,<br/>
What day the genial Angel to our Sire<br/>
Brought her in naked beauty more adorn’d,<br/>
More lovely then <i>Pandora</i>, whom the Gods<br/>
Endowd with all thir gifts, and O too like<br/>
In sad event, when to the unwiser Son<br/>

And starrie Pole: Thou also mad’st the Night,<br/>

Have finisht happie in our mutual help<br/>
And mutual love, the Crown of all our bliss<br/>

Strait side by side were laid, nor turnd I weene<br/>

Here Love his golden shafts imploies, here lights<br/>
His constant Lamp, and waves his purple wings,<br/>
Reigns here and revels; not in the bought smile<br/>
Of Harlots, loveless, joyless, unindeard,<br/>
Casual fruition, nor in Court Amours<br/>
Mixt Dance, or wanton Mask, or Midnight Bal,<br/>
Or Serenate, which the starv’d Lover sings<br/>
To his proud fair, best quitted with disdain.<br/>

Now had night measur’d with her shaddowie Cone<br/>
Half way up Hill this vast Sublunar Vault,<br/>

To thir night watches in warlike Parade,<br/>

With strictest watch; these other wheel the North,<br/>

Half wheeling to the Shield, half to the Spear.<br/>
From these, two strong and suttle Spirits he calld<br/>
That neer him stood, and gave them thus in charge.<br/>

This Eevning from the Sun’s decline arriv’d<br/>
Who tells of som infernal Spirit seen<br/>
Hitherward bent (who could have thought?) escap’d<br/>
The barrs of Hell, on errand bad no doubt:<br/>
Such where ye find, seise fast, and hither bring.<br/>
</p>
<p class="poem">
So saying, on he led his radiant Files,<br/>
Daz’ling the Moon; these to the Bower direct<br/>
In search of whom they sought: him there they found<br/>
Squat like a Toad, close at the eare of <i>Eve</i>;<br/>
Assaying by his Devilish art to reach<br/>
The Organs of her Fancie, and with them forge<br/>
Illusions as he list, Phantasms and Dreams,<br/>
Or if, inspiring venom, he might taint<br/>
Th’ animal Spirits that from pure blood arise<br/>
Like gentle breaths from Rivers pure, thence raise<br/>
At least distemperd, discontented thoughts,<br/>
Vain hopes, vain aimes, inordinate desires<br/>
Blown up with high conceits ingendring pride.<br/>
Him thus intent <i>Ithuriel</i> with his Spear<br/>
Touch’d lightly; for no falshood can endure<br/>
Touch of Celestial temper, but returns<br/>
Of force to its own likeness: up he starts<br/>
Discoverd and surpriz’d.  As when a spark<br/>
Lights on a heap of nitrous Powder, laid<br/>
Fit for the Tun som Magazin to store<br/>
Against a rumord Warr, the Smuttie graine<br/>
With sudden blaze diffus’d, inflames the Aire:<br/>
So started up in his own shape the Fiend.<br/>
Back stept those two fair Angels half amaz’d<br/>
So sudden to behold the grieslie King;<br/>
Yet thus, unmovd with fear, accost him soon.<br/>

<p class="poem">
Which of those rebell Spirits adjudg’d to Hell<br/>
Com’st thou, escap’d thy prison, and transform’d,<br/>

The lowest of your throng; or if ye know,<br/>
Why ask ye, and superfluous begin<br/>

Think not, revolted Spirit, thy shape the same,<br/>
Or undiminisht brightness, to be known<br/>
As when thou stoodst in Heav’n upright and pure;<br/>
That Glorie then, when thou no more wast good,<br/>
Departed from thee, and thou resembl’st now<br/>
Thy sin and place of doom obscure and foule.<br/>
But come, for thou, be sure, shalt give account<br/>
To him who sent us, whose charge is to keep<br/>
This place inviolable, and these from harm.<br/>

So spake the Cherube, and his grave rebuke<br/>
Severe in youthful beautie, added grace<br/>

His loss; but chiefly to find here observd<br/>
His lustre visibly impar’d; yet seemd<br/>
Undaunted.  If I must contend, said he,<br/>
Best with the best, the Sender not the sent,<br/>
Or all at once; more glorie will be wonn,<br/>
Or less be lost.  Thy fear, said <i>Zephon</i> bold,<br/>
Will save us trial what the least can doe<br/>
Single against thee wicked, and thence weak.<br/>

The Fiend repli’d not, overcome with rage;<br/>
But like a proud Steed reind, went hautie on,<br/>
Chaumping his iron curb: to strive or flie<br/>

His heart, not else dismai’d.  Now drew they nigh<br/>
The western point, where those half-rounding guards<br/>
Just met, &amp; closing stood in squadron joind<br/>
Awaiting next command.  To whom thir Chief<br/>

O friends, I hear the tread of nimble feet<br/>
Hasting this way, and now by glimps discerne<br/>

But faded splendor wan; who by his gate<br/>
And fierce demeanour seems the Prince of Hell,<br/>
Not likely to part hence without contest;<br/>
Stand firm, for in his look defiance lours.<br/>

By thy example, but have power and right<br/>
To question thy bold entrance on this place;<br/>

Whose dwelling God hath planted here in bliss?<br/>

To whom thus <i>Satan</i> with contemptuous brow.<br/>

Who would not, finding way, break loose from Hell,<br/>
Though thither doomd?  Thou wouldst thy self, no doubt,<br/>
And boldly venture to whatever place<br/>
Farthest from pain, where thou mightst hope to change<br/>
Torment with ease, &amp; soonest recompence<br/>
Dole with delight, which in this place I sought;<br/>
To thee no reason; who knowst only good,<br/>

And now returns him from his prison scap’t,<br/>
Gravely in doubt whether to hold them wise<br/>
Or not, who ask what boldness brought him hither<br/>
Unlicenc’t from his bounds in Hell prescrib’d;<br/>
So wise he judges it to fly from pain<br/>
However, and to scape his punishment.<br/>
So judge thou still, presumptuous, till the wrauth,<br/>
Which thou incurr’st by flying, meet thy flight<br/>
Seavenfold, and scourge that wisdom back to Hell,<br/>
Which taught thee yet no better, that no pain<br/>
Can equal anger infinite provok’t.<br/>
But wherefore thou alone? wherefore with thee<br/>
Came not all Hell broke loose? is pain to them<br/>
Less pain, less to be fled, or thou then they<br/>
Less hardie to endure? courageous Chief,<br/>
The first in flight from pain, had’st thou alleg’d<br/>
To thy deserted host this cause of flight,<br/>
Thou surely hadst not come sole fugitive.<br/>

Murmuring, and with him fled the shades of night.<br/>
